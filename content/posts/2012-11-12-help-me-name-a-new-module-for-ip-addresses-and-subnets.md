We created a few new modules for working with IP addresses and subnets at [MaxMind][1] which we'd
like to release. Internally we've been calling them `MM::Net::IPAddress` and `MM::Net::Subnet` but
obviously those names won't work for CPAN.

I've posted a [PrePAN review request][2] to discuss this further.
