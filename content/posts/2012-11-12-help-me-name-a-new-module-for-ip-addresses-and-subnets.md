We created a few new modules for working with IP addresses and subnets at [MaxMind][1] which we&#8217;d like to release. Internally we&#8217;ve been calling them `MM::Net::IPAddress` and `MM::Net::Subnet` but obviously those names won&#8217;t work for CPAN.

I&#8217;ve posted a [PrePAN review request][2] to discuss this further.
