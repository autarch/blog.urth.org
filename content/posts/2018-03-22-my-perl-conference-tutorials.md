I&#8217;m doing two tutorials this year at [The Perl Conference!][1]

On Thursday, June 21 I&#8217;ll be offering my [Introduction to Moose][2] course once again. If you want learn more about using Moose this is a great opportunity. I&#8217;d also note that most of what I cover applies to Moo, so what you&#8217;ll learn is useful in many situations.

On Friday, June 22 I&#8217;m bringing back my [Introduction to Go][3] course. I did this in 2015 and then put it on the shelf as I wasn&#8217;t doing so much Go for a while. But now I&#8217;m knee deep in Go again so it seemed like a good time to bring the course back. This course is aimed at folks who know another language (like Perl, for example) but don&#8217;t know anything about Go.

Both courses cost $165, which is a great deal in my humble opinion.

You can [purchase your tutorial tickets through Eventbrite][4], along with your ticket to the main portion of the conference. I hope to see you there!
