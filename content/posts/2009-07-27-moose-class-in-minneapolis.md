I have this one day Moose class I've developed. I was supposed to give it at YAPC, but I was sick and cancelled my trip.

Here's the class summary I wrote for YAPC:

> This will be an interactive hands-on course all about Moose. Moose is an OO system for Perl 5 that provides a simple declarative layer of "sugar" on top of a powerful, extensible meta-model.
> 
> With Moose, simple classes can be created without writing any subroutines, and complex classes can be simplified. Moose's features include a powerful attribute declaration system, type constraints and coercions, method modifiers ("before", "after", and "around"), a role system (like mixins on steroids), and more. Moose also has a vibrant ecosystem of extensions as seen in the variety of MooseX:: modules on CPAN.
> 
> This course will cover Moose's core features, dip a toe into the meta-model, and if there's time, explore some of the more powerful MooseX:: modules available on CPAN
> 
> Students are expected to bring a laptop, as you will be writing code during the class. You will also be provided with a tarball a week or so before the class is scheduled, which will contain a directory tree skeleton and test files.

The class ended up being taught by Shawn Moore, and I got a lot of good feedback about the class slides and exercises.

I'd really like to give the class myself, and I am trying to figure out if there's interest in the Twin Cities, MN area. I'd reserve a conference room at a hotel or on the UMN campus in Minneapolis or St Paul for the class, and I'm hoping to do this some time in August or September.

Normally, a one-day training session like this would run about $500 per person, but since this would be my first time actually giving the class, the rate would be a mere $120 per person.

In return, I want each attendee to commit to answering a short survey I'll give them after the class so I can get feedback on the class and my teaching. So there is a small price for the discount ;)

In order to make this happen, I'd need at least 5 people to sign up.

If you have questions, feel free to ask in a comment or [email me][1] or [email the Minneapolis Perl Mongers list][2].

If you're interested in attending, please let me know what days of the week are best. Would you prefer a weekday, Saturday, or Sunday? Or maybe it doesn't matter. Again, leave a comment or [email me][1].

If there is enough interest, I'll schedule it and then announce it on this blog and Minneapolis Perl Mongers list.
