Having just spoken to one Perl friend who didn&#8217;t know that The Perl Conference Call for Papers is open, I&#8217;m thinking it&#8217;d be good to spread the word.

The Perl Conference (formerly known as YAPC::NA) [Call for Presentations][1] is open. They are accepting proposals until March 6, 2017, but sooner is always better!

Here&#8217;s some more info from their website:

> The Perl Conference is a high-quality, inexpensive technical conference that celebrates the Perl programming language. The conference is accessible to everyone, regardless of experience, yet it remains valuable to the most skilled programmers. Each year the conference attracts hundreds of programmers from around the world, including luminaries such as Larry Wall, Ricardo Signes, and Damian Conway. We hope you will consider applying to present at this exciting event!
> 
> TPC 2017 in DC will be held at the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) _[in Alexandria, VA]_ from June 18-23.

I think \*\*conference\*\* should focus on beginners like getting started with perl, OOP in perl and not the least regex grammar in perl6. Its been obscure to me, so there should be a tutorial on regex grammar from scratch for beginners.

I&#8217;m not a conference organizer so I&#8217;m not sure why you&#8217;re posting this here. That said, there has been a pretty concentrated effort to have a good selection of beginner-focused talks at YAPC (now TPC) the past few years.
