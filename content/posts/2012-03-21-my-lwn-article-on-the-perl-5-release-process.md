I wrote an article for LWN (Linux Weekly News) about the [Perl 5 release process][1] a couple weeks back. It was originally behind a paywall but it's now readable by anyone.

Another article I wrote will be published later today. I'll post a link here once it's out from behind the paywall.

Please consider subscribing to LWN if you like this sort of thing, of course.
