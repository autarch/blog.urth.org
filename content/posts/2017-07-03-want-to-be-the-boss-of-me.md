If you've ever wanted to tell me what to do in a situation where I had to actually listen to you,
well, the opportunity has finally arrived!

ActiveState is hiring a new [VP of Engineering/CTO][1] (I have no idea why we can't pick a single
title here). You'd be managing all of the development teams at the company, including my team, the
Languages Team.

The one catch is that you'd either have to live in Vancouver or be prepared to travel there once a
month. But Vancouver is a really nice city and the real estate is only a little more expensive than
SF or NYC. Hey, it's cheaper than Hong Kong, at least! But if you like flying and traveling then
visiting once a month from a city with a saner market is a great opportunity.
