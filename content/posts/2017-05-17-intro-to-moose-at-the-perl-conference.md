I'll once again be offering my [Introduction to Moose class][1] at this year's [Perl Conference][2]. The class takes places on Sunday, June 18, the day before the main conferences starts.

This is a one day course that will teach you all the basic Moose features. It's very hands-on and interactive, so you'll be writing code for about half of the class time. That's much more interesting than listening to me drone on endlessly!

The course costs a mere $150? Why not buy two? Get one for your grandmother! You can [purchase your tickets through EventBrite][3]. And of course there are lots of other great course to choose from featuring instructors such as Damian Conway, Mark Jason Dominus, and Randal Schwartz.

I hope to see you there!
