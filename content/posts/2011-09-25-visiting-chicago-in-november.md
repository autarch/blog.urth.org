I&#8217;m going to be in Chicago for [Chicago VeganMania][1] on Saturday, November 5. I&#8217;ll be arriving late afternoon on Thursday, November 3, and leaving in the afternoon on Sunday, November 6.

I&#8217;ll be pretty busy, so I can&#8217;t promise to get together with everyone or anyone, but [ping me][2] via email if you want to get together and I&#8217;ll get back to you once I have a better sense of my schedule.

Would you want to give a talk about something if I could round up a group?

@Andy: Thanks for asking, but I don&#8217;t want to commit to something like that. This is more like &#8220;if I have time, I might meet up with folks for a meal&#8221;. I don&#8217;t want to try to organize anything more than that, because I really don&#8217;t know my schedule yet, except that I&#8217;ll be busy during the festival (10-5 on Saturday).
