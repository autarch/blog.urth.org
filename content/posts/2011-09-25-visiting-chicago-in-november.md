I'm going to be in Chicago for [Chicago VeganMania][1] on Saturday, November 5. I'll be arriving late afternoon on Thursday, November 3, and leaving in the afternoon on Sunday, November 6.

I'll be pretty busy, so I can't promise to get together with everyone or anyone, but [ping me][2] via email if you want to get together and I'll get back to you once I have a better sense of my schedule.

Would you want to give a talk about something if I could round up a group?

@Andy: Thanks for asking, but I don't want to commit to something like that. This is more like "if I have time, I might meet up with folks for a meal". I don't want to try to organize anything more than that, because I really don't know my schedule yet, except that I'll be busy during the festival (10-5 on Saturday).
