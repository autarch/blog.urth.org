[MaxMind, Inc.][1], the company I work for, is [hiring a Senior QA Engineer][2]. This position is a
development position, but your job will focus on writing tests, especially on automating functional
testing, helping us build test tools, and working with support and customers to understand and
document bugs. You won't really be developing end products, nor do we expect you to spend a lot of
time doing manual testing except when that's necessary for reproducing bugs or building a test
suite.

We'd really like to find someone with a strong interest and background in QA, not just a developer
looking for any development job. We have a growing body of unit tests, but there are still many
aspects of our products that need better testing and would benefit from functional tests that focus
on how users interact with our products.

Perl experience would be helpful since our system is written in Perl, and we expect new tools to be
written in Perl unless there's an existing tool in another language that does the job.
