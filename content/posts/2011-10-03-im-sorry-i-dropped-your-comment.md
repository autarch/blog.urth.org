My blog has been getting absolutely flooded with spam recently (c. 4,000+ in the last few days), and I&#8217;ve accidentally sent some legit comments to the great spam filter in the sky. The various spam plugins I have caught the vast majority, but that still left a few dozen a day for me to review.

My general policy is to approve all comments, even the obnoxious trolling stuff that follows any mention of a code of conduct. So if you submitted a comment and it didn&#8217;t show up, I&#8217;m sorry about that.

Just now, I found three legit comments on my last post I&#8217;d accidentally spam-bucketed. I&#8217;ve now published them, but anything on older posts is long gone.

You&#8217;ll notice I&#8217;ve added a captcha form to the comments. It&#8217;s annoying, but it should slow down the spam, I hope.

If I dropped a comment of yours, feel free to re-submit it, and I will approve it soon.

Also, note that if you log in with an OpenID login (or some other authentication method), your comment is automatically approved.
