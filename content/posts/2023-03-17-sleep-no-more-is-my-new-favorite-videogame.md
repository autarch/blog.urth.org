Last Saturday my wife and I saw [Sleep No More](https://mckittrickhotel.com/sleep-no-more/) in New
York City. It's a mostly silent film noir style adaptation of Macbeth as a play/dance piece. There
are no seats. Instead you follow the performers around the space, which is four floors of a
converted hotel. You can walk through nearly all of the sets in full, and you can more or less go
where you want. You don't even have to follow any performers at all if you don't want to.

I really loved it and I'm already planning to go back in the future. As I was thinking about _why_ I
loved it, I realized that it tickles the same part of my brain as some videogames. In particular, I
think it's a lot like the experience of playing [Dishonored](https://bethesda.net/game/dishonored)
and similar stealth games.

When I play a game like Dishonored, there are two aspects of it I enjoy the most. The first is
simply exploring the spaces that the game gives you. I find it incredibly rewarding to form a map of
a new space in my head, and to look into all the nooks and crannies for fun visual details. Sleep No
More lets you do _exactly_ the same thing. You can wander around the whole space, which is fairly
large and filled with small visual details. I honestly think I could spend many hours just looking
through the rooms without the performers there.

The other fun part of Dishonored is observing the stories of the characters around you. If you're
playing the game in stealth mode[^1] you will spend a fair bit of time following the NPCs around,
listening to their conversations and learning their routines. Simply doing this and staying out of
sight is really fun. Sleep No More gives you a similar experience, though you don't need to stay out
of sight.

So I'm definitely planning to attend Sleep No More again, and this time I'm aiming for 100%
completion with all achievements!

[^1]: This is the only _proper_ way to play it in my opinion.
