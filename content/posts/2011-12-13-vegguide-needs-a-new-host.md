For many years, the [VegGuide][1] site has been hosted for free at [Xmission][2], courtesy of Eric Waters. Eric has recently moved to a new position and is no longer at Xmission, so it&#8217;s time for us to find a new host.

**Update**: The site is owned by my animal rights group, [Compassionate Action for Animals][3], and we are a 501(c)(3) non profit organization.

If anyone in the lights of these pixels could offer free or cheap hosting for this site, please [let me know][4].

The site needs a dedicated host, either real or virtual, with at least 1.5GB of memory and 20GB of disk space. It&#8217;s bandwidth use is fairly modest, approximately 800MB of outgoing traffic per day at the moment (around 24GB per month). Incoming traffic is about half of that. However, we&#8217;d like room to grow in that regard, as I&#8217;m hoping we&#8217;ll be able to increase usage over the next couple years.

We can take care of all the sysadmin bits, so all we need to start is a box running Ubuntu Hardy and the site will be good to go.

Thanks again to Eric and Xmission for hosting the site gratis all these years.
