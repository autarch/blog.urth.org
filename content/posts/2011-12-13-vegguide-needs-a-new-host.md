For many years, the [VegGuide][1] site has been hosted for free at [Xmission][2], courtesy of Eric
Waters. Eric has recently moved to a new position and is no longer at Xmission, so it's time for us
to find a new host.

**Update**: The site is owned by my animal rights group, [Compassionate Action for Animals][3], and
we are a 501(c)(3) non profit organization.

If anyone in the lights of these pixels could offer free or cheap hosting for this site, please [let
me know][4].

The site needs a dedicated host, either real or virtual, with at least 1.5GB of memory and 20GB of
disk space. It's bandwidth use is fairly modest, approximately 800MB of outgoing traffic per day at
the moment (around 24GB per month). Incoming traffic is about half of that. However, we'd like room
to grow in that regard, as I'm hoping we'll be able to increase usage over the next couple years.

We can take care of all the sysadmin bits, so all we need to start is a box running Ubuntu Hardy and
the site will be good to go.

Thanks again to Eric and Xmission for hosting the site gratis all these years.
