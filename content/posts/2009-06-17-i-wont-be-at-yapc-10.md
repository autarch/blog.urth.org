So a few weeks ago I got an infection that&#8217;s quite painful to have. The infection is gone but the pain lingers on, and according to my doctor can linger for months.

I realized today that I am still exhausted from being sick, as well as being involved in the planning of three major events over the last six months or so &#8211; Frozen Perl, my AR group&#8217;s fundraising banquet, and our [conference this past weekend][1].

To compound things, because of the pain I&#8217;m in, I can&#8217;t sleep comfortably lying down, so I&#8217;ve been sleeping a comfy chair in my living room for a few weeks. I was really dreading trying to sleep in a hotel, since they wouldn&#8217;t have comfy chairs.

So I decided to cancel the trip, even though I really didn&#8217;t want to. My wife helped me realize that I _needed_ to.

Fortunately, Shawn Moore, Jon Rockway, and Stevan Little are helping make sure the Moose class will still happen. Some of the content will be slightly different, but I think it will still be quite good. I&#8217;ve already written a little more than half the material, and I will write some more over the next few days. Shawn and Jon also have existing talks that cover topics I wanted to cover in the class, so they will include those talks.

Overall, I think the class will work out, and I&#8217;m really thankful to Shawn, Jon, and Stevan for agreeing to jump in at the last minute. Since the class is on Sunday, I&#8217;m sure people have arranged their travel schedules specifically to be there, and I&#8217;d really be sad if there was no class for them to attend.

I&#8217;m still planning to be at OSCON (I _better_ be recovered enough by then), and I&#8217;m still considering YAPC::Asia.

I hope everyone has a good time in Pittsburgh.

I wrote a little about how the class will go at <a href="http://blog.sartak.org/2009/06/shawn-m-moose-at-yapc.html" rel="nofollow">my blog</a>. I&#8217;m sure Jon and I can make it work.

I&#8217;m a tiny bit sad we won&#8217;t get to play Go; maybe at Frozen Perl 2010? :) Anyway. Relax, get plenty of rest, and get well soon!

Aw, I hope you feel better soon! We&#8217;ll have to go get some yummy vegan food in San Jose in July =)

I heard great things about the Moose class despite everything.  
Hope you feel better soon!

You were missed! Hope your recovery goes well. I&#8217;m not signed up for OSCON but maybe I&#8217;ll head down to hang out one night.
