So a few weeks ago I got an infection that's quite painful to have. The infection is gone but the pain lingers on, and according to my doctor can linger for months.

I realized today that I am still exhausted from being sick, as well as being involved in the planning of three major events over the last six months or so - Frozen Perl, my AR group's fundraising banquet, and our [conference this past weekend][1].

To compound things, because of the pain I'm in, I can't sleep comfortably lying down, so I've been sleeping a comfy chair in my living room for a few weeks. I was really dreading trying to sleep in a hotel, since they wouldn't have comfy chairs.

So I decided to cancel the trip, even though I really didn't want to. My wife helped me realize that I _needed_ to.

Fortunately, Shawn Moore, Jon Rockway, and Stevan Little are helping make sure the Moose class will still happen. Some of the content will be slightly different, but I think it will still be quite good. I've already written a little more than half the material, and I will write some more over the next few days. Shawn and Jon also have existing talks that cover topics I wanted to cover in the class, so they will include those talks.

Overall, I think the class will work out, and I'm really thankful to Shawn, Jon, and Stevan for agreeing to jump in at the last minute. Since the class is on Sunday, I'm sure people have arranged their travel schedules specifically to be there, and I'd really be sad if there was no class for them to attend.

I'm still planning to be at OSCON (I _better_ be recovered enough by then), and I'm still considering YAPC::Asia.

I hope everyone has a good time in Pittsburgh.

I wrote a little about how the class will go at [my blog](http://blog.sartak.org/2009/06/shawn-m-moose-at-yapc.html). I'm sure Jon and I can make it work.

I'm a tiny bit sad we won't get to play Go; maybe at Frozen Perl 2010? :) Anyway. Relax, get plenty of rest, and get well soon!

Sorry to hear you can't make it. I hope you feel better soon.

Aw, I hope you feel better soon! We'll have to go get some yummy vegan food in San Jose in July =)

I heard great things about the Moose class despite everything.  
Hope you feel better soon!

You were missed! Hope your recovery goes well. I'm not signed up for OSCON but maybe I'll head down to hang out one night.
