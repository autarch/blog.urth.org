I have not one, but two, count 'em two, piping hot positions open on the Build Engineering team I manage here at [ActiveState][1]!

The [ActiveState Careers page][2] has two Build Engineer positions open, [one for Linux][3] and [one for Windows][4]. We're going to hire two people, but we could hire two of one and not the other. That said, I would **really** love to bring in some Windows build expertise to this team, so if that's you please apply today.

Also, in the nearish future (by 2019 ideally) we will be looking for someone else to manage this team (I'm managing two at the moment). If you have ambitions in that direction this could be a perfect opportunity for you.

While we’d prefer to hire someone in the Vancouver area this position is open to remote candidates anywhere in North America.

ActiveState is a really great company to work for. The culture is by far the best of any company I’ve worked for, and I really like the people I work with.

Feel free to comment here or grab me on IRC/Slack/[email][5] if you have any questions. If you want to talk about salary please just apply. The first step after resume review is a quick phone conversation with our recruiter Patrick. You can talk to him about exactly that question during the call.

I look forward to seeing your applications.

There are also some software engineering positions on other teams open too, one for a [Full Stack Developer][6] (working on CLI and web tools for our new product) and one for a [Sr. Developer in Developer Tooling][7] (aka devops). Both of these positions are also open to telecommuters anywhere in North America.
