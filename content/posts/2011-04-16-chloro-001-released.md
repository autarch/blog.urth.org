_(I'm still [looking for a new position][1]. Please [check out my resume][2] and [contact me][3] if
you're looking for a great Perl developer.)_

There was a lot of interest in Chloro, my new form library, when I [blogged about it last week][4].

I just released 0.01. I've started integrating Chloro into a [web app][5] that I'm developing, and I
really like using it so far.

That said, this release should be considered an alpha, and I reserve the right to completely rewrite
it for the next release. Don't start using it unless you're okay with that.
