The [last time I wrote about this]({{< relref
"2021-10-15-what-do-i-want-from-my-next-job-.md" >}}) was 8 days after I left
my last position, at [ActiveState](https://www.activestate.com/). Since
writing that post, I've continued to think about what I want, and my thinking
has evolved.

----

**TLDR:**

* Top tier TC _or_ a 4 day week, and both would be ideal (but unlikely).
* 5+ weeks of PTO.
* Yes++ to Rust. No Java or PHP.
* No companies in certain fields like crypto.
* I want to do a significant amount of IC work, even if I'm in a management
  position.

Reflecting on how I felt last October, I was well and truly burned out. The
past few years had been quite tough for me. In September of 2020, my mother
died. Then a few months later, my father moved to Minneapolis from Florida. We
purchased a duplex together. He moved in right away, and my wife and I moved
in a few months later in April of 2022.

This was a lot to deal with. Soon after, some things had happened at my job
that had made me unhappy. I think if this had been a different time in my
life, I would have fought harder to change these things[^0]. But at this
particular time, I mostly felt exhausted and discouraged. I didn't have the
energy to tackle the issues that had come up. So instead, I waited until we
sold our previous house, which gave us enough cash in the bank for me to take
some time off.

I'm really glad I did that. This break has been fantastic. I've ended up
coding more during this break than I did at ActiveState. It's amazing how easy
it is to write code when you're the only customer and you can work on whatever
you want.

But I've also been thinking more about what I want from my next job, and more
broadly, what I want out of life[^1].

## Working Less vs Compensation

Last time I wrote about this, I said this:

> ~~My number one criteria for my next job is being able to work 4 days per
> week (or less)~~.

But I think this was mostly my burnout talking. While I do like the idea of
working less, what I realized was that this should be a long-term goal
too. That means that I should be willing to work a bit more now to work less
later. Specifically, if I can retire earlier than average, that's a lot less
working.

So here's my new number one goal:

> **I want to work less, but that doesn't have to happen this year or the
> next.**

All of which is to say that I think I'd be perfectly happy to take a higher
compensation 5-day job right now so I can save a significant amount of money
towards earlier retirement. I'm not aiming for the full
[FIRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement). I'm already too old for
that. But I think it's realistic to aim to retire in my late 50's or early
60's.

But I'd still consider a 4-day week too, with the expectation that the highest
TC[^2] jobs will probably require 5 day weeks.

## PTO

I also said:

> **I also want at least 5 weeks of PTO per year.**

This still seems pretty reasonable. I'm sticking with this one, especially if
I'm working 5 days a week.

## Languages and Technology

**I'd still love to work with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).** During the
last 5 months I've mostly been writing Rust, and I've greatly enjoyed it. I
haven't touched Go since I left ActiveState, though I plan to refresh myself
before I start interviewing in earnest.

Everything else I said in my last post about this topic still stands true.

## Company Size and Stage

I'm still open to pretty much anything. If I want to focus more on total
compensation, I think I will by necessity be looking at larger companies as
well, and that's fine.

## IC[^3] or Management?

Same as last time. I'm open to either, but if I'm managing I'd like to be able
to code as well.

## Company's Product

Again, same as last time.

* No crypto/blockchain.
* No social networking[^4].
* No gig economy work for non-professionals.

I'd also add "no companies that use animals or animal products", though this
is uncommon in the tech field anyway. I guess I'd probably be avoiding many
biotech companies because of animal testing, but given my skill set, I don't
think I'd be a good fit for that field anyway.

## Narrowing it Down

My hard requirements are:

* Top tier TC _or_ a 4 day week, and both would be ideal.
* 5+ weeks of PTO.
* Yes to Rust. No Java or PHP.
* No companies in the unacceptable fields I've mentioned.
* I want to do a significant amount of IC work, even if I'm in a management
  position.

[^0]: Yes, I'm being vague. There's no need to air dirty laundry.
[^1]: I'm 48, which means my life is very likely more than half over. I think
    it's good to keep that in mind as I make big decisions.
[^2]: TC = total compensation
[^3]: IC = individual contributor, aka not management
[^4]: I also included "surveillance capitalism" in my last post, but it occurs
    to me I'm not 100% sure what that means. I need to think this one through
    a bit more clearly. I know I wouldn't work for Facebook, but would I work
    for Google? My gut instinct is that they have many products that seems
    perfectly fine to work on, like [GCP](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
