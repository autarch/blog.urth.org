Well, I thought I was getting better, but I was wrong. Last week my infection seems to have had a resurgence, and I&#8217;m not feeling well enough to travel.

Yuval Kogman has offered to teach the Moose tutorial at OSCON, so that will still go on, assuming O&#8217;Reilly agrees to the switch.

I&#8217;m still hoping to go to Italy in October. If I&#8217;m not recovered by then, I&#8217;m just going to have to get a robot body, because this meat sack is not working out so well.

Hope you feel better soon (regardless of Moose lectures) :)
