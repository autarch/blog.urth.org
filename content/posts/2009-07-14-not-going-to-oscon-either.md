Well, I thought I was getting better, but I was wrong. Last week my infection seems to have had a resurgence, and I'm not feeling well enough to travel.

Yuval Kogman has offered to teach the Moose tutorial at OSCON, so that will still go on, assuming O'Reilly agrees to the switch.

I'm still hoping to go to Italy in October. If I'm not recovered by then, I'm just going to have to get a robot body, because this meat sack is not working out so well.

Hope you feel better soon (regardless of Moose lectures) :)
