My current position at Thomson Reuters is a contract position scheduled to end on April 29. It looks like budget constraints dictate that this contract won&#8217;t be renewed, so it&#8217;s time for me to get my interviewing shoes on.

I&#8217;m looking for consulting work (part time up to about 30 hours a week). My skill set includes Perl (no kidding), Javascript, web applications, non-web applications (batch data processing, daemons, etc), database design, testing, development processes, and lots of other good stuff. [My resume][1] is up to date as of a few minutes ago.

Please [contact me][2] if you&#8217;re looking for a great developer.
