Have you ever tried to tell me what to do, only to find I ignored you? Well, now you can tell me what to do and I'll _have_ to listen to you! Want me to drop and do 50 push-ups? Sure! Shine your shoes? Done! Be your number one Yes Man? Yes, Boss!

MongoDB is hiring a Lead Engineer to lead the Verification and Correctness team within Cluster to Cluster Synchronization. You will be leading and coaching a team of engineers who are working to make migration of MongoDB clusters easy, fast, and reliable for our customers, as well as work with product managers and program managers to specify, prioritize and deliver new features that delight our users.

That's my team, so your dreams of making me your servant can finally come true[^1]! [Apply today](https://grnh.se/0ef999ff1us)!
