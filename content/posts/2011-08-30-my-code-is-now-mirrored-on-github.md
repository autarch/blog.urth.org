Per the request of various folks, all of my code is now mirrored on [GitHub][1]. I'm still pushing to my [personal server][2], but I've set up hooks to then mirror to GitHub. I'll be happy to accept patches via a github repo and/or pull request. I wrote some code to manage the mirroring, which can be found in my [git-bits repo][3]. It's not ready for CPAN, but it might be useful to others who want to do something similar.
