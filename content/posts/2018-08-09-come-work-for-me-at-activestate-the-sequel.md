A while back I posted about a development position on my team. Now I have a new position open for a
Build Engineer.

If you take a look at the [ActiveState Careers page][1] you'll see that there are actually two Build
Engineer positions open, [one for Linux][2] and [one for Windows][3]. We're only going to hire one
person but we wanted to be open to people with different skillsets and backgrounds. Ultimately,
whoever takes this job will be doing builds on Linux, Windows, macOS, and some big iron systems like
AIX. Please note that this is not a software development position. There will be a little coding,
but it's mostly in the form of automating builds.

While we'd prefer to hire someone in the Vancouver area this position is open to remote candidates
anywhere in North America.

ActiveState is a really great company to work for. The culture is by far the best of any company
I've worked for, and I really like the people I work with.

Feel free to comment here or grab me on IRC/Slack/[email][4] if you have any questions. If you want
to talk about salary please just apply. The first step after resume review is a quick phone
conversation with our recruiter Patrick. You can talk to him about exactly that question during the
call.

I look forward to seeing your applications.

There are also some software engineering positions on other teams open too, one for a [Developer
Experience Engineer][5] (working on CLI and web tools for our new product) and one for a [Sr.
Developer in Developer Tooling][6] (aka devops). Both of these positions are also open to
telecommuters anywhere in North America.
