I'm very excited to announce the first release of the new Moose::Manual documentation as part of the Moose 0.66 release. This is part of the documentation work being funded by [the Moose docs grant from TPF][1].

One of the complaints we often hear about Moose is that the docs are not good enough, and that it's hard to get started with it. The Manual was created to address this issue. I'm hoping that it will be a good starting point for people to understand Moose concepts and features. After reading it, you should be able to start creating Moose-based classes right away.

I also hope that people will give us feedback on the Manual. It's still new, and I'm sure there are parts that need polish, and concepts which were left out. If there's something you're confused about or wish were documented, please [email me][2] or visit the [Moose IRC channel][3] and tell us.

It doesn't seem that Moose 0.66 has hit CPAN just yet. Is there any place where people could get Moose::Manual?

Thanks!

It shouldn't be too much longer, but for the record Moose svn (soon moving to git, I suspect) is at <a href="http://code2.0beta.co.uk/moose/svn" rel="nofollow ugc">http://code2.0beta.co.uk/moose/svn</a>,
