The company I work for is considering hiring a Product Manager, but we&#8217;re trying to get a better sense of if this should be a full time job for a company our size, with 15 people ~5 devs (some people are not full time).

If you work with one who you think is good at their job (or you are one) I&#8217;d love to schedule 15-30 minutes to pick that person&#8217;s brain. We want to get a sense of what the job description is, and how their time is used.

I promise not to directly solicit people that we interview later on if we decide to hire for this position.

Please email me at <drolsky@maxmind.com> if you can put me in touch with someone to talk to.
