The company I work for is considering hiring a Product Manager, but we're trying to get a better
sense of if this should be a full time job for a company our size, with 15 people ~5 devs (some
people are not full time).

If you work with one who you think is good at their job (or you are one) I'd love to schedule 15-30
minutes to pick that person's brain. We want to get a sense of what the job description is, and how
their time is used.

I promise not to directly solicit people that we interview later on if we decide to hire for this
position.

Please email me at <s>dead email address</s> if you can put me in touch with someone to talk to.
