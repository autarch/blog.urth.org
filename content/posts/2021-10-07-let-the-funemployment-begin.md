Today was my last day at [ActiveState](https://www.activestate.com/). I enjoyed my nearly five years
there (starting in February of 2017), but for a variety of reasons I decided to leave. I'm in the
very fortunate position of being able to be jobless for a while, I'm not planning to look for
anything new until January of 2022 at the earliest.

I have some programming projects of my own that I plan to work on, and I'll post about them here if
they turn into anything interesting. I'm also maybe open to short-term consulting gigs (a few days
or weeks, not months) if someone wants to throw sufficiently large amounts of money at me.
[Email me](mailto:autarch@urth.org) if you're interested.
