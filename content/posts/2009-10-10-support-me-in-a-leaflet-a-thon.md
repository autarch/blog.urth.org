First off, there's no technical content in this blog post. Sorry.

I'll be participating in a leaflet-a-thon next week with my animal advocacy group, [Compassionate
Action for Animals][1]. This is like a walkathon, but with less walking and more handing stuff out.

To those within the light of my pixels, if you'd like to support me, you can do so by [making a
donation online][2]. Even if you don't particularly support the cause, please consider doing this to
support _me_. If you've used a module I've written, you could say thanks by making a donation.

Thanks,

-dave
