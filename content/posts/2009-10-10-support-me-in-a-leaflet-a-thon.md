First off, there&#8217;s no technical content in this blog post. Sorry.

I&#8217;ll be participating in a leaflet-a-thon next week with my animal advocacy group, [Compassionate Action for Animals][1]. This is like a walkathon, but with less walking and more handing stuff out.

To those within the light of my pixels, if you&#8217;d like to support me, you can do so by [making a donation online][2]. Even if you don&#8217;t particularly support the cause, please consider doing this to support _me_. If you&#8217;ve used a module I&#8217;ve written, you could say thanks by making a donation.

Thanks,

-dave
