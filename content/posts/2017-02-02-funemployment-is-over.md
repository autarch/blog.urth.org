Being unemployed the last four weeks has been fun, except for the whole lack of income thing. But now it&#8217;s time to actually do something productive for a change.

I&#8217;ll be joining [ActiveState][1] as the new Languages Team Lead, Senior Software Engineer (that&#8217;s a mouthful), managing the team that does language builds as we add a whole set of new languages to the fold. I&#8217;m looking forward to helping ActiveState grow and improve our language products in various interesting ways.
