Being unemployed the last four weeks has been fun, except for the whole lack of income thing. But now it's time to actually do something productive for a change.

I'll be joining [ActiveState][1] as the new Languages Team Lead, Senior Software Engineer (that's a mouthful), managing the team that does language builds as we add a whole set of new languages to the fold. I'm looking forward to helping ActiveState grow and improve our language products in various interesting ways.
