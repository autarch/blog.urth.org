The sign up for classes at this year&#8217;s YAPC is a little different than before. You sign up by pledging to a crowdfunding campaign on Crowdtilt. If enough people pledge then the class will happen (and you will be charged). So if you&#8217;re interested in taking my Introduction to Moose class, please [sign up now][1]!

This class is a one day, interactive introduction to Moose. **The class will take place on Sunday, June 22**, the day before the conference proper begins. The cost of the class is a mere $130 for a full day!

Here&#8217;s what one past student said about the class:

> Great class. I especially liked your problem sets. You gave out problems you expected your class to actually solve, and you allowed class time for solving them. This should be a basic expectation for any class, but it&#8217;s amazing how often teachers don&#8217;t do this.

You can find more details about the class content on [the class&#8217;s crowdtilt page][1].
