The organization formerly known as &#8220;autarch-code&#8221; is now called [&#8220;houseabsolute&#8221;][1]. I think some folks may not have wanted to transfer a repo to an organization named &#8220;autarch-code&#8221;. The new name is hopefully a little less &#8220;all about Dave&#8221;. I also changed the picture, though I really miss the old one, because I thought it was hilarious. I&#8217;ve saved it here on this blog for posterity.

Am I insane? No, I&#8217;m not. Clearly. This is the product of a perfectly sane mind. Trust me.
