I recently tried using Claude to look at [my `ubi` project](https://github.com/houseabsolute/ubi/)
and tell me about any bugs it found. To avoid having to pay for Claude Code, I used the web API and
uploaded a tarball of [the `ubi` crate](https://github.com/houseabsolute/ubi/tree/master/ubi), which
contains all the important bits of `ubi`.

I was curious to see how well it would do. AI tools for coding have improved a _lot_ in the past
year (and probably in the past month and week). Would it find a lot of bugs I'd never noticed, or
would it be full of nonsense?

Here's the full report it produced:

<h1>Bug Analysis: UBI Asset Selection Logic</h1>

## Overview

This document contains a detailed analysis of potential bugs and issues in the ubi (Universal Binary
Installer) project's asset selection logic, based on reviewing the source code in `picker.rs`,
`installer.rs`, `archive.rs`, `os.rs`, and `arch.rs`.

## Critical Bugs

### 1. **Android Detection Too Broad, Linux ARM64 Confusion**

**Location:** `os.rs`, line 7 and `picker.rs`, lines 170-173

**Issue:** The Android regex is simply `(?i:android)` without word boundaries, and the special-case
filtering only applies when `platform.target_os != OS::Android`:

```rust
if os_matcher.is_match(&asset.name) {
    if self.platform.target_os != OS::Android && android_re().is_match(&asset.name) {
        debug!("does not match our OS");
        continue;
    }
```

**Problems:**

1. The Android regex can match filenames containing "android" anywhere, even as part of another word
2. The logic assumes Linux matches will come first, then filters Android, but both might match
3. A file like `myapp-armandroid-linux.tar.gz` might be incorrectly filtered

**Impact:** This caused the bug mentioned in release notes where ubi incorrectly picked Android
releases on Linux aarch64.

**Fix:** Use word boundaries for Android regex: `regex!(r"(?i:(?:\b|_)android(?:\b|_))")` and ensure
proper OS precedence.

---

### 2. **Exact Match Doesn't Check Executability** üî¥ CRITICAL

**Location:** `installer.rs`, lines 368-370

**Issue:** When an exact filename match is found in an archive, the code immediately returns it
WITHOUT checking if the file is executable:

```rust
if self.archive_member_is_exact_match(file_name) {
    debug!("found {archive_type} file entry with exact match: `{file_name}`");
    return Ok(Some(i));  // Returns immediately, no executable check!
}
```

This is even documented in the README: "Note that if it finds an exact match, it does not check the
file's mode."

**Impact:**

- On Unix systems, if an archive contains both a non-executable script and an executable binary with
  the project name, the non-executable might be selected
- A malicious or poorly structured archive could have a non-executable data file with the right name
  that gets selected over an actual executable

**Example Failure:**

```
archive/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ myapp (mode 644, data file)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ myapp-linux-x86_64 (mode 755, actual executable)
```

The non-executable `myapp` would be selected.

**Fix:** Always check executability, even for exact matches on Unix systems.

---

### 3. **ARM Regex Too Permissive on macOS**

**Location:** `arch.rs`, lines 40-62

**Issue:** The `macos_aarch64_only_re()` includes just `arm` as a match:

```rust
(?:
    aarch_?64
    |
    arm_?64
    |
    arm        // Too broad!
)
```

**Impact:**

- Will match `armv7`, `armhf`, `arm-linux`, `armchair`, etc.
- Could incorrectly select 32-bit ARM binaries on ARM64 macOS
- Recent fix changed from "arm64" to "arm", making it even broader

**Example:** A file named `myapp-darwin-armv7.tar.gz` would match on macOS ARM64.

**Fix:** Be more specific: require either 64 indicators or use negative lookahead to exclude 32-bit
variants.

---

## Significant Bugs

### 4. **64-bit Filter Uses Naive String Search** ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH SEVERITY

**Location:** `picker.rs`, lines 322-335

**Issue:** The 64-bit filtering uses a simple substring search for "64":

```rust
if !matches.iter().any(|a| a.name.contains("64")) {
    debug!("no 64-bit assets found, falling back to all assets");
    return matches;
}

let sixty_four_bit = matches
    .into_iter()
    .filter(|a| a.name.contains("64"))
    .collect::<Vec<_>>();
```

**Problems:**

1. **Matches version numbers**: `myapp-v1.64.2-linux-i686.tar.gz` would be considered 64-bit even
   though it's i686 (32-bit)
2. **Matches years**: `myapp-2064-edition-arm32.tar.gz` would be considered 64-bit
3. **Matches hashes/IDs**: `myapp-build-abc64def-armv7.tar.gz` would be considered 64-bit
4. **Matches other contexts**: `sha64`, `base64`, `sha256464`, etc.

**Impact:** Can incorrectly include 32-bit binaries in the "64-bit" filter results. While x86_64 can
run 32-bit x86 binaries, this breaks down for other architectures:

- On ARM64, should prefer `aarch64` over `arm32`
- On x86_64, should prefer native 64-bit over 32-bit compatibility mode
- The wrong binary might be selected based on alphabetical ordering if both pass through

**Example Failure Scenarios:**

Scenario 1 - Version number interference:

```
Platform: aarch64 (ARM64)
Assets:
  - myapp-v1.64.0-linux-armv7.tar.gz  (contains "64", but is 32-bit ARM!)
  - myapp-v1.63.0-linux-aarch64.tar.gz (no "64" in version, but IS 64-bit!)
Result: Selects the 32-bit ARM binary because it has "64" in version number
```

Scenario 2 - Build IDs:

```
Platform: x86_64
Assets:
  - myapp-linux-i686-build642.tar.gz (contains "64", but is 32-bit)
  - myapp-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
Result: Both pass the filter, then alphabetical sort picks one arbitrarily
```

**Proper Fix - Architecture-Specific 64-bit Detection:**

Replace the naive string search with architecture-aware regex matching:

```rust
fn maybe_filter_for_64_bit_arch(&self, matches: Vec<Asset>) -> Vec<Asset> {
    // Only filter on 64-bit architectures
    if !matches!(
        self.platform.target_arch,
        Arch::AArch64
            | Arch::Mips64
            | Arch::PowerPc64
            | Arch::Riscv64
            | Arch::S390X
            | Arch::Sparc64
            | Arch::X86_64
    ) {
        return matches;
    }

    let asset_names = matches.iter().map(|a| a.name.as_str()).collect::<Vec<_>>();
    debug!(
        "found multiple candidate assets on 64-bit platform, filtering for 64-bit binaries in {asset_names:?}",
    );

    // Create architecture-specific 64-bit indicator regex
    let bit64_re = self.arch_64_bit_indicator_regex();

    let sixty_four_bit: Vec<Asset> = matches
        .iter()
        .filter(|a| bit64_re.is_match(&a.name))
        .cloned()
        .collect();

    if sixty_four_bit.is_empty() {
        debug!("no assets explicitly marked as 64-bit found, falling back to all assets");
        return matches;
    }

    debug!(
        "found 64-bit assets: {}",
        sixty_four_bit.iter().map(|a| a.name.as_str()).join(",")
    );

    sixty_four_bit
}

fn arch_64_bit_indicator_regex(&self) -> Regex {
    // Match architecture-specific 64-bit indicators near word boundaries
    let pattern = match self.platform.target_arch {
        Arch::X86_64 => r"(?i)(?:\b|_)(?:x86[_-]?64|x64|amd64)(?:\b|_)",
        Arch::AArch64 => r"(?i)(?:\b|_)(?:aarch64|arm64)(?:\b|_)",
        Arch::Mips64 => r"(?i)(?:\b|_)mips64(?:el|le)?(?:\b|_)",
        Arch::PowerPc64 => r"(?i)(?:\b|_)(?:ppc64|powerpc64)(?:le)?(?:\b|_)",
        Arch::Riscv64 => r"(?i)(?:\b|_)riscv64(?:\b|_)",
        Arch::S390X => r"(?i)(?:\b|_)s390x(?:\b|_)",
        Arch::Sparc64 => r"(?i)(?:\b|_)sparc64(?:\b|_)",
        _ => r"(?i)(?:\b|_)64(?:\b|_)", // Fallback for unknown 64-bit architectures
    };

    Regex::new(pattern).unwrap()
}
```

**Alternative Simpler Fix** (if full regex solution is too complex):

Use a more restrictive substring search that requires word boundaries around "64":

```rust
fn maybe_filter_for_64_bit_arch(&self, matches: Vec<Asset>) -> Vec<Asset> {
    if !matches!(
        self.platform.target_arch,
        Arch::AArch64 | Arch::Mips64 | Arch::PowerPc64
            | Arch::Riscv64 | Arch::S390X | Arch::Sparc64 | Arch::X86_64
    ) {
        return matches;
    }

    let asset_names = matches.iter().map(|a| a.name.as_str()).collect::<Vec<_>>();
    debug!(
        "found multiple candidate assets, filtering for 64-bit binaries in {asset_names:?}",
    );

    // Use a regex that requires 64 to be part of an architecture indicator,
    // not just anywhere in the string
    let bit64_re = regex!(r"(?i)(?:\b|_)(?:\w*64|64\w+)(?:\b|_)");

    let sixty_four_bit: Vec<Asset> = matches
        .iter()
        .filter(|a| {
            let name_lower = a.name.to_lowercase();
            // Must contain "64" with word boundaries, not in version numbers
            // Version number pattern: vX.64.Y or vX.Y.64
            let is_version = regex!(r"v\d+\.\d*64").is_match(&name_lower);

            bit64_re.is_match(&a.name) && !is_version
        })
        .cloned()
        .collect();

    if sixty_four_bit.is_empty() {
        debug!("no 64-bit assets found, falling back to all assets");
        return matches;
    }

    debug!(
        "found 64-bit assets: {}",
        sixty_four_bit.iter().map(|a| a.name.as_str()).join(",")
    );
    sixty_four_bit
}
```

**Benefits of the Fix:**

1. Architecture-specific matching prevents false positives
2. Explicitly excludes version numbers like "1.64.0"
3. Requires "64" to be part of an architecture indicator (word boundaries)
4. Falls back gracefully if no 64-bit indicators found
5. More maintainable - uses existing architecture regexes

**Testing Required:**

- `myapp-v1.64.0-linux-i686.tar.gz` should NOT match on x86_64
- `myapp-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` SHOULD match on x86_64
- `myapp-aarch64-darwin.tar.gz` SHOULD match on ARM64
- `myapp-arm64-v2.64.tar.gz` SHOULD match on ARM64 (arm64 indicator present, version ignored)

---

### 5. **MIPS Regex Ordering Issue**

**Location:** `arch.rs`, lines 122-138 and 158-174

**Issue:** The `mips_re()` regex will match `mips64` because it just looks for `mips`:

```rust
pub(crate) fn mips_re() -> &'static Lazy<Regex> {
    regex!(r"(?ix)(?:\b|_)mips(?:\b|_)")  // Matches "mips64"!
}
```

**Impact:** On a 32-bit MIPS platform, it might match 64-bit assets. The code relies on checking
`mips64` first, but if regexes are applied in wrong order, this fails.

**Fix:** Add negative lookahead: `mips(?!64)` or be more careful about ordering.

---

### 6. **Musl Detection Relies on External Binary**

**Location:** Mentioned in docs; detection happens before picker

**Issue:** The musl detection runs `ldd /bin/ls` to check for musl.

**Problems:**

1. `/bin/ls` might not exist on minimal systems or non-FHS systems
2. `ldd` might not be in PATH
3. The command might fail for other reasons
4. Users can't easily override false negatives

**Impact:** On musl systems without `/bin/ls`, detection fails and glibc binaries might be selected.

**Fix:**

- Check multiple common binaries
- Provide better fallback mechanisms
- Make the override mechanism more discoverable

---

### 7. **Libc Filtering is Too Lenient**

**Location:** `picker.rs`, lines 235-258

**Issue:** The libc matching allows assets without any libc indicator:

```rust
if asset.name.contains("-gnu") || asset.name.contains("-glibc") {
    debug!("indicates glibc and is not compatible with a musl platform");
    continue;
} else if asset.name.contains("-musl") {
    debug!("indicates musl");
} else {
    debug!("name does not indicate the libc it was compiled against");
}

libc_matches.push(asset.clone());  // Pushes even without musl indicator!
```

**Impact:** On musl systems, if there's an asset with no libc indicator and one with `-gnu`, the
code filters out `-gnu` but accepts the unmarked one, which might actually be glibc-linked.

**Example:**

- Platform: x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
- Assets: `app-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` (actually glibc), `app-linux-x86_64-gnu.tar.gz`
- Result: Selects the unmarked one, which might not work on musl

**Fix:** When on musl and multiple matches exist, prefer ones explicitly marked `-musl`.

---

### 8. **Windows Extension Checking**

**Location:** `installer.rs`, lines 376-384

**Issue:** On Windows, the code assumes files are executable without checking extensions properly:

```rust
if self.is_windows
    || matches!(
        entry.is_executable().with_context(|| {...})?,
        None | Some(true)
    )
{
    debug!("found {archive_type} file entry with partial match: `{file_name}`");
    possible_matches.push(i);
}
```

**Problems:**

1. Trusts that partial matches on Windows are executable
2. Might select data files like `myapp.txt` if they start with the right name

**Fix:** On Windows, verify the file has `.exe` or `.bat` extension before accepting partial
matches.

---

### 9. **Sorting Tiebreaker is Arbitrary**

**Location:** `picker.rs`, lines 293-302

**Issue:** When multiple assets remain after all filtering, the code sorts alphabetically and picks
the first:

```rust
Ok(filtered
    .into_iter()
    .sorted_by_key(|a| a.name.clone())
    .next()
    .unwrap())
```

**Problems:**

1. Completely arbitrary - depends on naming conventions
2. `aaa-tool-gnu.tar.gz` beats `zzz-tool-musl.tar.gz` alphabetically
3. No way to make this deterministic across projects with different naming
4. Can lead to selecting the wrong variant (GNU over musl, etc.)

**Impact:** Unpredictable behavior when multiple variants exist. The selected asset might not be
optimal.

**Fix:** Add better heuristics:

- Prefer tarballs over zip
- Prefer explicit libc matches over unmarked
- Consider file size (larger = more likely to be feature-complete)
- Make the selection criteria more explicit

---

## Minor Issues

### 10. **Partial Match Case Sensitivity**

**Location:** `installer.rs`, lines 410-420

**Issue:** The partial match checks case insensitively for the extension but case sensitively for
the prefix:

```rust
fn archive_member_is_partial_match(&self, file_name: &str) -> bool {
    if !file_name.starts_with(&self.exe_file_stem) {  // Case sensitive!
        return false;
    }
    if self.extensions.is_empty() {
        return true;
    }
    self.extensions
        .iter()
        .any(|&ext| file_name.to_lowercase().ends_with(ext))  // Case insensitive!
}
```

**Impact:** An archive with `MyApp` won't match if looking for `myapp`, even though the extension
matching is case-insensitive.

**Fix:** Make prefix matching case-insensitive too, or document the case-sensitivity requirement.

---

### 11. **No Validation of Extension Parsing**

**Location:** `picker.rs`, lines 121-123

**Issue:** Extension parsing errors are silently ignored:

```rust
match Extension::from_path(Path::new(&a.name)).with_context(|| {...}) {
    Err(e) => {
        debug!("skipping asset with invalid extension: {e}");
        false  // Just skips silently
    }
    ...
}
```

**Impact:** If there's a bug in extension parsing, valid assets might be silently skipped without
clear errors to the user.

**Fix:** Accumulate skipped assets and report them in debug mode or if no assets match.

---

### 12. **`--matching` Only Applied When Multiple Matches**

**Location:** `picker.rs`, lines 338-355

**Issue:** The `--matching` filter is only applied when `matches.len() > 1`:

```rust
fn maybe_filter_for_matching_string(&self, matches: Vec<Asset>) -> Result<Vec<Asset>> {
    if self.matching.is_none() {
        return Ok(matches);
    }
    // This is called from pick_asset_from_matches which is only called after filtering
    // So if there's only 1 match, this never gets called!
}
```

Actually looking at the code flow in `pick_asset_from_matches` (line 270), this is called even with
1 match, but the documentation says it's ignored with one match.

**Impact:** User confusion - they set `--matching` but it might not have the effect they expect if
there's only one platform match.

**Fix:** Document this behavior more clearly or apply matching earlier in the pipeline.

---

## Edge Cases & Robustness Issues

### 13. **No Fallback When 64-bit Filter Removes All Assets**

**Location:** `picker.rs`, lines 322-335

**Issue:** If all assets contain "64" but none are actually 64-bit, they all pass through. But if
some contain "64" and some don't, only "64" ones are kept.

**Example:**

- Platform: x86_64
- Assets: `app-v1.64-i686.tar.gz`, `app-v1.64-x86_64.tar.gz`
- Both contain "64", both pass through
- Then alphabetical sort picks one

**Impact:** Can still select wrong architecture even after "64-bit filtering."

---

### 14. **Zip and 7z Archives Don't Track Executability**

**Location:** `archive.rs`, lines 100-103, 160-163

**Issue:** These archive formats don't preserve Unix executable bits:

```rust
fn is_executable(&self) -> Result<Option<bool>> {
    // Zip entries do not mark whether something is executable.
    Ok(None)
}
```

**Impact:** On Unix, partial matches from zip files are always accepted (because `None` is treated
as executable), even if the file isn't actually executable in the archive.

**Fix:** On Unix, after extracting from zip/7z, verify the file is executable or try to make it
executable.

---

### 15. **Race Condition in Tarball Iteration**

**Location:** `installer.rs`, lines 129-138

**Issue:** The code iterates through the tarball twice - once to find the best match, then again to
extract it:

```rust
// First iteration to find index
let mut arch = tar_reader_for(downloaded_file)?;
let entries = arch.entries()...
if let Some(idx) = self.best_match_from_archive(...) {
    // Second iteration to extract
    let mut arch2 = tar_reader_for(downloaded_file)?;
    for (i, entry) in arch2.entries()... {
```

**Impact:**

- If the file is modified between iterations (unlikely but possible)
- If the archive is malformed, the second iteration might behave differently
- Performance cost of reading the archive twice

**Fix:** This is noted in comments as necessary due to API limitations. Could cache the path and
then use tar's by-name extraction if available.

---

## Recommendations

### High Priority Fixes

1. **Fix 64-bit filtering logic** - Use architecture-specific regex matching instead of naive string
   search for "64"
2. **Add executable check for exact matches** - Critical for security and correctness
3. **Improve ARM regex specificity** - Prevent matching 32-bit ARM variants
4. **Fix Android detection** - Use word boundaries

### Medium Priority

5. **Better musl detection** - Add fallbacks and try multiple binaries
6. **Smarter tiebreaker** - Use better heuristics than alphabetical sort
7. **MIPS regex fix** - Prevent mips_re from matching mips64

### Low Priority

8. **Case-insensitive partial matching** - More forgiving for users
9. **Better error messages** - Show what was skipped and why
10. **Document limitations** - Especially around zip/7z executability

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests Needed

1. **Test 64-bit filter with version numbers** - `myapp-v1.64.0-linux-i686.tar.gz` should NOT be
   selected on x86_64
2. **Test 64-bit filter with correct indicators** - `myapp-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` SHOULD be selected
   on x86_64
3. Test Android filtering with various Linux ARM64 asset names
4. Test exact match with non-executable file
5. Test ARM regex with armv7, armhf variants
6. Test musl filtering with unmarked binaries
7. Test partial match case sensitivity

### Integration Tests Needed

1. Test full asset selection with real-world release patterns
2. Test with archives containing multiple executables
3. Test cross-platform with various naming conventions
4. Test error cases (no matching assets, ambiguous matches)

### Property Tests

1. Asset selection should be deterministic given same inputs
2. Selected asset should always be compatible with platform
3. Filtering should monotonically decrease candidate set

---

## Conclusion

The asset selection logic in ubi is generally well-structured but has several bugs that can lead to
incorrect asset selection, particularly around:

- **64-bit architecture detection** (using naive string search instead of architecture-aware
  matching)
- Architecture matching for ARM variants and Android/Linux disambiguation
- Executable detection in archives (exact matches and zip/7z formats)
- Tiebreaking when multiple valid options exist

The most critical fix needed is improving the 64-bit filtering logic to use architecture-specific
regex patterns instead of a simple substring search for "64", which can match version numbers and
other non-architecture contexts.

Most of these issues can be fixed with more precise regex patterns and better filtering logic. The
codebase is well-tested but would benefit from additional tests covering the edge cases identified
here, particularly around version numbers interfering with architecture detection.

</details>

So how well did it do?

Well, on the plus side, it did spot a few real bugs. On the minus side, it was wrong a lot. Let's go
through each bug in detail.

## 1. **Android Detection Too Broad, Linux ARM64 Confusion**

Yes, this is a real bug. The OS matching regex of `(?i:android)`, without word boundaries, is not
good. It would matching things like "mandroid" and "bandroid". And in fact there are GitHub projects
with both of those words in their name!

However, it turns out that `ubi` simply wouldn't work _at all_ on Android, because I never checked
whether it was running on that OS elsewhere in the code.

But I consider this a hit in terms of bug detection, even though in practice it didn't matter. I
fixed the regex and enabled `ubi` to work on Android.

## 2. **Exact Match Doesn't Check Executability**

No, this is not a bug. This is in entirely intentional. If `ubi` looks through an archive and finds
an exact match for the executable name it expects (e.g. `precious` when it downloads from
https://github.com/houseabsolute/precious), then it will extract that.

Bonus points for calling out that "[a] malicious or poorly structured archive could have a
non-executable data file with the right name that gets selected over an actual executable". LOL. If
you are dealing with a malicious project, executable name matching is the least of your problems.
You can use `ubi` to download malware quite easily!

But you can also use _any_ tool that downloads tarballs to download malware.

## 3. **ARM Regex Too Permissive on macOS**

No, this is not a bug. Claude is assuming that when people create releases for their projects, they
name them very carefully. But trust me, they absolutely do not. People choose all sorts of nonsense
for naming. A release like `some-project-Darwin-arm.tar.gz` is fairly sane compared to some of the
things people do. The code _intentionally_ matches `arm` without a `64` here.

There's literally a comment in the code about doing this.

## 4. **64-bit Filter Uses Naive String Search**

Yes, this is a bug! I fixed the 64-bit matching to use a regex that looks for CPU names instead of
just the string `64`.

## 5. **MIPS Regex Ordering Issue**

No, not a bug. The code does not use _both_ the `mips_re` and `mip64_re` regexes on one system. Ubi
looks at what CPU you are running on and picks one of these regexes based on that.

## 6. **Musl Detection Relies on External Binary**

No? I mean, this musl detection code is really dumb. But I don't know of a better way to do this.

## 7. **Libc Filtering is Too Lenient**

Not a bug. In this case, `ubi` fails by downloading the wrong binary. If I made the filtering
stricter, it would sometimes fail by _not_ downloading a binary that could work. People use `ubi` to
download tools written in languages that don't link to the system's libc, like shell scripts,
Python, Go binaries, etc.

## 8. **Windows Extension Checking**

This is the same issue as #2 above, but on Windows, it's even more important to not check
executability, because zip files, which are very common for Windows releases, don't even include
that information!

## 9. **Sorting Tiebreaker is Arbitrary**

Maybe? The suggestion to prefer an asset with a libc in the name over one without isn't bad. I
wouldn't call this a _bug_, since it works as designed, but this could be improved. That said, I'm
not sure how often this matters. I haven't had any bug reports where changing this behavior would
improve `ubi` for someone.

## 10. **Partial Match Case Sensitivity**

Yeah, this is already called out in [issue #83](https://github.com/houseabsolute/ubi/issues/83).

## 11. **No Validation of Extension Parsing**

Eh, I guess. Maybe? This would be a lot of work for very little gain. When the extension parsing is
broken, I usually get a bug report ;)

## 12. **`--matching` Only Applied When Multiple Matches**

No, this is not a bug. This is literally exactly what the docs say it will do!

Also, it's _wrong_ in saying "this is called even with 1 match". I don't understand how it concluded
this.

## 13. **No Fallback When 64-bit Filter Removes All Assets**

This is a bit weird. The title doesn't match the bug description. But the title is wrong. Ubi _does_
have a fallback if the 64-bit filter removes everything.

Then the actual bug description seems to be about the issue #4, that the 64-bit filter is too
permissive.

## 14. **Zip and 7z Archives Don't Track Executability**

Not a bug. The behavior of `ubi` here is intentional, and Claude's suggestion of "after extracting
from zip/7z, verify the file is executable or try to make it executable" is nonsense. A file
extracted from a zip/7z is never going to be executable! And `ubi` already makes it executable (and
will do this with any archive file type).

## 15. **Race Condition in Tarball Iteration**

Yes, but no. Nothing is going to modify the file while `ubi` is working with it. I _guess_ it could
in theory be deleted by some sort of temp reaper, but whatever.

## In Summary

Out of 15 issues reported, here's my evaluation:

- It found 1 real and important bug, the 64-bit filtering issue, issue 4.
- It found 1 real bug that was irrelevant, the Android matching issue, issue 1. It did not notice
  that this particular code could never be executed.
- It asserted a bunch of things were bugs that are intentional behavior, issues 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 12,
  13, and 14.
- It found 1 thing I'd already noted in `ubi`'s issues, that executable matching should probably be
  case-insensitive, issue 10.
- It found some things that can be improved, but aren't very important, issues 6, 9, 11, and 15.

It's great that it found some legit bugs, and I'm glad to fix them. But this sure is a lot of noise.
For many of these, it seems like maybe it wasn't considering enough of the context (other code,
docs, etc.) when reporting something as a bug.

Would I do this again with other code bases? Yes, I think so. I didn't burn a ton of time on dealing
with the false positives, and I am happy it found at least one real bug that no one had reported
yet.
