I'll be offering my new [Introduction to Go class here in Minneapolis on Saturday, May 30][1]. The
cost is just $30 and I have 15 spots available.

I'm offering this class at such a low cost because I want to get some feedback on it before I give
it at [YAPC::NA::2015][2]. If this goes well, I plan to give this class in Minneapolis again, but
I'll be charging more, so now's your chance to [take the class][1] for as cheaply as it'll ever be
offered!
