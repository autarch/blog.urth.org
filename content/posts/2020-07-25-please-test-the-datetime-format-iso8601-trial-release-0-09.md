**Edit:** I'm now up to [a 0.11 trial release][1]. Please test that one instead.

I just did a trial release of this distro. It doesn't contain any radical changes, but I did enough
tweaking to the internals that I think it's best to make a trial release. If I don't get any bug
reports in the next few weeks I will do a non-trial release some time in August.
