The company I work at has posted a [new job opening for a senior developer][1]. So if you've always
wanted to work at a job with me (for some bizarre reason) now's your chance. Alternatively, consider
yourself warned.

Ok, here's some real info about the position. You'd be a senior developer on a small tech team (me
as team lead, two other devs, one sysadmin/dev, one CEO who needs to code less). The company is
small, there's flexibility in working hours, telecommuting is okay, and the pay is good. The code is
mostly Perl with a little C and C++.

The downside is we have an cruftastic code base that needs a lot of cleanup. The upside is that we
are actually allowed to clean it up! We're also writing new code that sucks less, with tests, docs,
code review, Moose, Web::Machine, Catalyst, and all that good stuff.
