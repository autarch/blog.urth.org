If you&#8217;ve visited my blog before, you might notice that it&#8217;s now running on WordPress rather than Moveable Type. I&#8217;m a little sad to be moving from a Perl application to one in PHP, but WordPress is just a better solution these days.

The main reason I moved was that I was stuck on MT4. When I first installed MT, I installed it with a Postgres backend. Then when MT5 was released, they dropped support for Postgres. That was a bit annoying, but I could live with it. The suggested upgrade solution was to export one&#8217;s blog, create a fresh MT5 install, and import. I tried that and the import failed every time. I posted a question on their support forum and never got an answer (fair enough, I wasn&#8217;t paying).

But in contrast, the tool to import from MT4 to WordPress pretty much just worked. So here we are.
