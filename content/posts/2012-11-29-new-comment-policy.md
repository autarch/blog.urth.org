Since I have some new blog software, I&#8217;m enacting a new comment policy to go with it.

In the past, I&#8217;ve approved basically all non-spam comments. After my last post, the only comment I received was a very rude comment suggesting that it was an attempt to &#8220;defend&#8221; my use of WordPress. I deleted this comment.

(Aside: see the footer of this site)

So the new policy is this:

Comments are always welcome, whether you agree with anything I write or not. However, I expect you to be civil to both me and other commenters. Name-calling, threats, baseless accusations, and asshattery will all be deleted.

I wish more websites had such a comment policy.
