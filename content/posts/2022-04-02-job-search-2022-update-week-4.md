Has it been four weeks? I can't remember. I've been told there was a time before the interviews,
before the coding challenges, before the system design questions. But I can't remember. That life is
gone, lost in the haze. All I have now is the interviews, the endless stream of questions and
scheduling requests. My only hope now is that this infinity will end, but how can infinity end?
That's the paradox that consumes my waking thoughts.

If I add it all up, I had 11.5 hours of interviews this past week. That doesn't seem like much when
I write it down, but it sure _felt_ like a lot while I was doing it.

Fun fact, a lot of the people I talk to have read these blog posts! That's not surprising, since I
link to this blog from my resume and online profiles. From what I can tell, nothing I've written has
alarmed anyone _too_ much.

Originally, in my [week 2 post]({{< relref
"2022-03-19-job-search-2022-update-week-2.md" >}}) I had said I am "terminally blunt" and someone
did ask about that. I realized that wasn't the best wording, and I've since edited that blog post.
What I was trying to express was that I don't like the types of social lies where I'm lying and the
person I'm speaking to knows I'm lying, but social convention says I should lie anyway. I'd rather
just tell the truth. But the phrase "terminally blunt" makes me sound like I could be a huge
asshole. I will leave it to those who know me to judge whether I am, but I am sure that none of my
references will say that I am.

Again, I'll start with the list of places that simply have not responded beyond the initial
automated "thanks for your application":

- Cockroach Labs - applied on 2022-03-21
- GitHub - applied on 2022-03-10
- Netflix - applied on 2022-03-11
- Oso - applied on 2022-03-10

I added Cockroach Labs since it's been two weeks since my application now.

ClickHouse is no longer on the list! I have a first interview with someone there next Monday. Can I
get through the process with them and other slow movers before I have enough offers that I should
just pick one? Maybe they'll move fast. Let's see.

I didn't submit any _new_ applications this week, and at this point I'm responding to all[^1] new
incoming requests with "thanks but I'm too busy for more interviews".

Here's this week's updates ...

I had an initial call with a recruiter at 1Password. I had applied for an engineering manager
position because I thought from the job description the role involved a fair bit of IC work too. But
it was much less than I wanted. The recruiter said they'd run my resume and interests by all hiring
managers to see if maybe there was a management position that fit what I wanted, or if they wanted
to consider me for an IC role. The next day I got a generic "we've decided not to move forward with
the role you applied for" email. So I'm not sure if they actually considered me for anything else.

Maybe they thought I was trying to do some sort of bait and switch application. Is that a thing? How
could that possibly work?. I didn't apply for any IC roles because at the time I didn't see any that
seemed like a good fit. Maybe I was right and that hasn't changed. Oh well.

I still hadn't heard back from Array by Tuesday, March 29, six days after submitting my homework, so
I emailed the recruiter to check in. My homework was well received and they just needed to get the
CTO's feedback. I ended up meeting with the CTO on Friday morning and he was very positive about my
application. They're hiring for several teams so we talked about which might be the best fit for me,
and I'll move forward with one of those teams next week.

I spoke to a different recruiter at Fastly and I have an interview with a hiring manager scheduled
for next Wednesday. I'd like to move this one along since at one interview per week the process will
take way too long. If things go well next week I will politely tell the hiring manager that.

I got an offer from LogDNA! It's a good offer, but I told them that I need to wait to see other
offers before I make any decisions.

I had a metric forkton of interviews with MongoDB on Monday and Tuesday. This included a couple live
coding exercises, one on concurrency and one on algorithms, as well as a live systems design
challenge. I think I did really well on the concurrency exercise, fairly well on the systems design
challenge, and not so well on the algorithms exercise. I have a lot more to say about these sorts of
live exercises, as well as homework/take-homes, but I'll save it for after I accept an offer[^2].

I did a live coding exercise with OneSignal as well. This went quite well. I have a "virtual onsite"
(aka circa three hours of interviews) scheduled for next week.

One thing about OneSignal that stands out is the detailed interview guide materials that they give
you. These materials detail what types of interviews you'll be having, what topics they'll cover,
the qualities they're looking for, and they give some guidance on how to prepare. This is great!
Every company should do this! If I end up somewhere beside OneSignal I might try to make this happen
there.

I met with several people from Oden, including the CEO, another engineering manager, a software
engineer, and a product person. This included a systems design challenge with an interesting
structure. For the first hour, I worked with an engineer who presented the problem. I sketched out a
design in Lucidchart and made a bunch of notes. Then after a short break, I met with a product
person. I explained the design to them and we talked about various potential issues.

If I had to pick one company right now based purely on the _product_ (ignoring offer details, tech
stack, company size, etc.), it'd probably be Oden. As a refresher, they do data collection and
analytics for factory production lines. This is quite interesting, and it'd be totally new for me.

But of course, all those other details besides the product matter a lot too. And fortunately, every
company I've spoken to has an interesting product that will involve some sort of new challenge for
me, whether that be its scale, learning a new field, or something else.

I had a couple more interviews with Optic, including one with an engineer and another chat with
their CEO. They're a very early stage startup (just 5 people right now, I believe), but it sounds
like they have a reasonable work/life balance. I greatly enjoy having a chance to talk to company
CEOs and learn more about the product vision, their growth and funding plans, the challenges they
face beyond the technical ones, and other high-level details. This is a perk of interviewing with
smaller companies, and it was an aspect of my interview process at ActiveState I liked a lot back
in 2017.

And that's this week's update. The list is slowly shrinking, and I'm hoping that I will be able to
make a decision by Friday, April 15 at the latest. After that, I suspect the gating factor on my
start date will be laptop availability.

    If someone reaches out about a job that pays $1 million a year with 20 weeks of PTO and a 4-day
    week, I'll definitely respond. Again, my email is [autarch@urth.org](mailto:autarch@urth.org).

    Translation, I'm gonna complain about these big time but I don't want to do it mid-process in
    case it makes any potential employer mad.
