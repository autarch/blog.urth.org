A friend recently commented on a Facebook post asking for some reading recommendations, which I then gave him (boy, did I ever!). But I realized that  I don't want it to just disappear down the Facebook memory hole so I'm reposting it here.

## Blogs (EA/rationalist/politics/philosophy)

  * [Slate Star Codex][1] - EA, rationalist, lots of nerdy philosophy/political stuff.
  * [Areo Magazine][2] - Liberal Left but not "Progressive" articles, writing quality varies but mostly good.
  * [Charlie's Diary][3] - The blog of Charles Stross, noted SF author - lots of content about writing and politics.
  * [Hormones Demystified][4] - The most fascinating endocrinology blog I've ever read (also the only one I've ever read) - has a lot of good content about the state of the US medical system.
  * [Heterodox Academy][5] - Promoting political diversity in academia.
  * [Overcoming Bias][6] - Robin Hanson's blog, where he will piss off just about everybody by analyzing every topic under the sun using economics!
  * [Status 451][7] - Collaborative blog with multiple authors across the political spectrum, mostly about politics and "culture wars" topics.
  * [Thing of Things][8] - More EA, politics, and random stuff, including insightful & funny book reviews.

## Blogs (AR and veganism)

  * [Wild-Animal Suffering Research][9]
  * [The Vegan RD][10] - Ginny Kisch Messina's excellent blog on vegan nutrition.

## Blogs (pure entertainment)

  * [The Weirdest Band in the World][11]

## Books, nonfiction

This isn't something I read a lot of so mostly older stuff.

  * _The Rest is Noise_ by Alex Ross - Excellent book on modern music (starts w/ Strauss & Mahler at the end of Romanticism) - also has a really cool companion website with lots of audio snippets and links.
  * Douglas Hofstadter's books, especially _Gödel, Escher, Bach_ (which everybody has already read) and _I Am a Strange Loop_.
  * _Sleights of Mind_ by Stephen Macknik, Susana Martinez-Conde and Sandra Blakeslee - About the neuroscience of magic tricks and how magicians exploit how the human brain works.
  * _The Selfish Gene_ by Richard Dawkins - A deeper exploration of evolution than you get in high school, plus this is where the word "meme" comes from!
  * _Republic, Lost_ by Lawrence Lessig - A good way to get yourself to give up entirely on the US political system, or at least to start supporting the [MAYDAY.US PAC][12].
  * Books about security by Bruce Schneier - the most recent one I read was _Liars & Outliers_ - really good for introducing security concepts to the layperson and generally enjoyable reading.

## Books, fiction

Mostly speculative fiction. Well, this list could go on forever. Here's a few (?) favorite authors:

  * Gene Wolfe - start with The Wizard Knight books or _The Fifth Head of Cerberus._
  * Ursula K. LeGuin (RIP) - one of the greatest SF authors of all time. If you haven't read the Earthsea books what are you waiting for?!! Also check out _The Left Hand of Darkness_ and _The Disposessed_.
  * N.K. Jemisin - Her latest series, starting with _The Fifth Season_, is fantastic. Every book in the series has won at least one major SF award (Hugo or Nebula), and the awards are well deserved.
  * Jacqueline Carey - I love her writing, the stories are just beautiful and moving. My favorites are the Kushiel books starting with _Kushiel's Dart_.
  * Steven Brust - Funny, intelligent, thoughtful, filled with fun references - The Vlad Taltos books are my favorite but it's a planned seventeen book series so maybe too much of a commitment. Maybe read _The Brokedown Palace_, which is a totally standalone book in the same setting but with different characters and basically no crossover with the Taltos stories or people.
  * Iain M. Banks (RIP) - The Culture novels are some of my favorites, but his non-culture SF is also great. Start with _Player of Games_ for Culture or _Against a Dark Background_ for a standalone.
  * Seanan McGuire - Start with _Discount Armageddon_. If you like that you'll probably like her other work.
  * John Crowley - _Little, Big_ is a truly mind-blowing novel. But you have to stick with it. The plot doesn't really become clear until after a few hundred pages, but it's totally worth it, trust me.
  * Mary Gentle - _The Black Opera_ is a great standalone book from her, but I like everything of hers that I've read.
  * China Miéville - _Embassytown_ is a quick read and if you like it you'll probably like his other works. Weird stuff.
  * Jeff Vandermeer - Wrote _Annihilation_ which was a recent film. I loved this series, but my favorites are his Ambergris books. The best is _Shriek_, but you need to read _City of Saints and Madmen_ first (which is also really good).
  * Sean Williams - Sadly stopped writing fiction a while ago. Start with _Cloud's End_. I think he has the most beautiful prose of any author in the SF genre that I've ever read.
  * Dozens more including Charles Stross, Karl Schroeder, Robin Hobb, Robin McKinley, Ian R. MacLeod, Jonathan Lethem, John Scalzi, Paul Kearney, Mike Carey, Claire North, Glen Cook, R. Scott Bakker, Kate Elliott, Elizabeth Hand, Christopher Barzak, Nina Kiriki Hoffman, Steph Swainston, Michael Swanwick, Vernor Vinge, Robert Charles Wilson, Matt Ruff, Richard Paul Russo, Lemony Snicket, Alastair Reynolds, Brandon Sanderson, Jim Butcher, Peter S. Beagle, Walter Mosley (mostly mysteries), Juliet McKenna, Neal Stephenson, James Alan Gardner, Kristin Cashore, Sarah Monette (also writes as Katherine Addison), and probably a bunch of others I'm leaving out unintentionally.

I read a lot, I guess.
