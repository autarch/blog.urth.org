I&#8217;d like to offer my Intro to Moose class at the Pittsburgh Perl Workshop this coming October, but we&#8217;re not sure if there&#8217;s enough interest to justify it. If you think you&#8217;d like to take the class, please put your name on the [Moose Class wiki page for PPW][1]. This isn&#8217;t a binding commitment, but don&#8217;t sign up just cause you&#8217;re vaguely considering it. Some recent feedback about the class &#8230;

> I thought Dave&#8217;s class was outstanding. Well prepared and highly valuable content. &#8211; Chris Fedde
> 
> It damn sure was a good use! It would&#8217;ve been a huge mistake not taking your class; Moose is a magnificent beast and I couldn&#8217;t have picked a better primer. &#8211; Brian Fraser
> 
> The class was great. There was a nice balance of material presented to hands-on experimentation, and alternating between lecture and exercises helped nail down concepts. &#8211; Philip Monsen

If I can get a minimum of 6 people signed up for $150 each I can justify doing this.
