After some recent conversations with Unny, [CAA][1]&#8216;s Development Coordinator, I&#8217;ve started thinking about whether or not the idea of _being_ vegan is a barrier to entry for animal advocacy.

Is vegan something I _am_, or is veganism simply something I _do_?

I&#8217;ve long said that &#8220;I am vegan&#8221; to people when describing my diet and/or my ethics. It&#8217;s a nice simple shorthand. However, it also defines me in a way that &#8220;living a vegan lifestyle&#8221; does not.

I&#8217;m not sure we should talk about veganism as part of one&#8217;s identity. This sort of framing may actually discourage people from making a change. Changing one&#8217;s self-identity is a big deal. On the other hand, asking someone to act on the feelings of compassion _that they already have_ is much less of a big deal. Instead of telling that they need to change who they are, we are just acting them to change their _behavior_. Even better, we&#8217;re asking them to change their behavior so that it&#8217;s in accordance with their stated values.

At CAA, we&#8217;ve long taken a low-pressure approach of encouraging people to &#8220;explore veganism&#8221;. If someone tells us that they can&#8217;t become vegan, we encourage them to make whatever change they can. This change in framing seems like a natural extension of that &#8220;soft&#8221; approach.

The problem with all of this is that it&#8217;s incredibly awkward to _not_ say &#8220;I&#8217;m vegan&#8221; in spoken conversation. Saying &#8220;I live a vegan lifestyle&#8221; just sounds weird. I can&#8217;t imagine that this language will be adopted. This is especially unlikely since the people who already have experienced a change in self-identity probably want to hold on to that identity!

However, I think that we can approach this sort of change slowly. For a beginning, we can look at the written materials we use to pursue animal activism, and modify them to emphasize that veganism is a matter of lifestyle, not identity. We can also make a point of describing things as vegan (food, clothes, etc.), not people.

[Vegan Outreach][2] has a great line in [one of their essays][3], &#8220;we want a vegan world, not a vegan club.&#8221; I suspect that making veganism an identity furthers the creation of that club.

I didn&#8217;t really got your point up to the &#8220;world vs club&#8221; quote,  
but there is something to it,  
when we categorize ourselves as &#8220;some-word&#8221;,  
people who don&#8217;t consider themselves in that category  
will categorize themselves as &#8220;not that word&#8221; (if not some opposite word),  
and if they think of themselves as &#8220;not that word&#8221;,  
as part of their identity/personality/ believe,  
switching to the &#8220;other team&#8221; might feel like a dramatic change  
or even losing a part of who you are,  
and even if not, it may still give a feeling of  
canceling ones general past approach,  
which in order to justify,  
one must stick with or immediately face (all at once)  
the illegitimate of it&#8217;s previous life style,  
which may be too overwhelming, scary and hard to do.  
For a solution I’ll have to get back to you when I’ll think of something.  
Right now I don’t see any way around it,  
Unless you want to specify every aspect of your way of life,  
you need a short way to say a lot.  
The shortest way is dome word which describe what you want as it’s definition,  
but than you get a category word, splitting everyone to “us” and “them”.  
Maybe the solution should be something like instead of naming ourselves,  
we can name our thought / life style,  
like veg-thinking, or veg-living, veg-choosing ? (.. sound weird).  
I’ll leave the name choosing to some one more fit to do so (which includes most people)  
Naming just 1 of our choices, instead of defining our entire personality,  
Which might separate us from anyone who doesn’t define he/she’s entire personality  
as a word he/she doesn’t truly understand the emotional purpose nor spirit of.  
But I won’t be surprised to learn this approach  
will with time (once the word is publicly known) will collapse back into the very  
same problem it’s aim to solve.  
Hoping someone got a better solution.  
Good luck and live well (live-veg)
