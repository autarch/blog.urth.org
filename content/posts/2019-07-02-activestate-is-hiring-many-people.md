We're embarking on a large expansion of our engineering team at ActiveState and [hiring for many
positions][1]! Note that all of our engineering positions are totally remote-friendly. You can work
from anywhere in North America!

The positions on my team are the [Data Engineer][2] and [Senior Backend Engineer][3] positions.
Consider yourself warned.

Please note that **the various Build Engineer positions are not software development roles!** Those
roles are primarily focused on getting software to build on various platforms (including Linux,
macOS, and Windows). The language specialist positions require deep expertise of the language's
ecosystem and build tooling. They are **not** simply about having expertise coding in that language
(though that is probably helpful).
