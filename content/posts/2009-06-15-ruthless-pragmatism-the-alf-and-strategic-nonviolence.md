**Update:** The first version of this entry was all mixed up with the next entry. That's now fixed.

This past weekend's [TLOV 2009][1] conference is over, and I have a lot to think about. In
particular, I both agreed and disagreed with much of pattrice jones' keynote on Sunday afternoon.

Her keynote outlined an approach to animal rights based on the axiom that "animals exist". This
means that animals are creatures with desires that need to respected right now, as opposed to in
some future theoretical sense. As a consequence, this requires animal activists to act with
"ruthless pragmatism", which may mean doing things that make us ethically uncomfortable.

I (mostly) agree.

She said that simply getting people to go vegan is not enough. She stated that in order to win we
have to both reduce demand _and_ raise the costs of doing (animal abuse) business.

I agree with this as well, but with some caveats.

Pattrice praised both the ALF as well as welfare legistation like Prop 2. It's true, both do raise
the costs of doing business. The welfare legislation also has a real impact on actual animals, and
so is worthy in and of itself (as long as there's not something even more useful we could be doing).

But let's tackle the ALF. Is the ALF ruthlessly pragmatic? I don't think so. In fact, the ALF is one
of the most idealistic "organizations" I know of. Certainly, they're not metrics-based, methodical,
or any of the other things I associate with pragmatism.

Pattrice says that the ALF has cost animal abuse industries millions of dollars through their
vandalism and animal releases over the years of their existence. So how much is "millions"? [In
2002, The FBI testified before Congress that the ALF and ELF combined had caused $43 million in
damage since 1996][2]. From my reading online, it seems like ELF is more damaging in their
activities, but let's be generous and split it. That means that the ALF is doing approximately $20
million in damage (in the US) every five years.

The first question, then, is does this damage raise the cost of doing business? Second, is this the
most effective thing that these activists could be doing?

I think the first question is relatively easy to answer. In the _US alone in 2006_, the [mink "crop"
sold for approximately $136 million][3] at auction. [Looking back at previous years][4], wholesale
mink pelt values at auction were more than $1 billion from 1998-2007.

So we have an industry making $1 billion in 10 years (in the US alone) **at wholesale**! The retail
amounts are even more staggering. Retail fur sales were $1.34 billion in 2007 alone.

So given those numbers, is it reasonable to think that the ALF's generously estimated $40 million in
the same time period had an impact on the fur industry? I don't think so. Even if all $40 million in
damage had been taken just by mink "farmers" (which it wasn't), that's less than 5% of their income.
Unless their margins are ridiculously low, it's hard to imagine this being a major problem.

Even if this caused a 5% increase in retail costs, fur coats are a luxury good. Luxury goods have a
lot of price elasticity, and a 5% increase in price may have a 0% impact on sales! And given the 10x
markup from wholesale to retail, there's clearly room for retailers to absorb a 5% increase in the
costs paid to wholesalers.

This might all sounds like I'm saying that the ALF just needs to get out there and do a lot more
damage. At some amount of damage, they would be able to have a serious impact on prices, and this
would eventually decrease sales, which in turn would decrease production.

The problem with this approach is that we haven't yet looked at the costs to the animal rights
movement. I'd love to argue that the ALF's actions are detrimental to the movement as a whole. They
make us look bad, and make it hard to get people to listen to us. But that's a somewhat nebulous
argument.

A more solid argument is that the costs to the ALF activists themselves are very, very high. Any
activist who is involved in a significantly damaging action wil become a high-priority target for
law enforcement. The most likely outcome is that they will be caught, turned into witnesses against
their cohorts, and/or put in jail for long periods of time. Either way, they are no longer able to
be activists for a significant period of time, and they are certainly not able to repeat their ALF
actions on a regular basis.

So the price of "success" for an ALFer is to stop being an activist for a non-trivial amount of
time. Of course, this "success" also imposes a cost on the larger movement, as well-meaning
supporters spend money and time on the ALFer's legal defense and jail support.

The animal rights movement cannot compete with animal ag when it comes to money. In their 2007
fiscal year, [HSUS had approximately $100 million in income][5]. HSUS is by far the biggest 501c3
working on animal rights in the US, and arguably only some of their money goes to "animal rights"
work (I'm not knocking HSUS for that, BTW, I think they're great).

PETA, which is probably the next biggest organization, brought in about $30 million.

That's pocket change compared to the combined financial resources of the animal abuse industries.
Mink wholesale alone is equivalent to the income of the two top AR charities in the US. The fur
industry is miniscule compared to farmed animals. In 2007, beef producers alone brought in $50
billion wholesale.

That's a lot of big numbers, and it seems overwhelming. How can we possibly win? Well, we need to be
ruthlessly pragmatic. I think that [strategic nonviolence][6] is the ruthlessly pragmatic philosophy
that shows us the way to victory.

Strategic nonviolence analyzes the disparity in power between us and our opponents, and shows us
that we do have one big advantage. We are on the side of justice, and our cause is morally
persuasive. Animals _do_ deserve equal consideration, and they _are_ being horribly tortured by
humans. We can use this morally persuasive argument to convince members of the public to join our
cause and support us.

But we cannot fight toe-to-toe with money or violence. Our opponents can outspend and outfight us
quite easily. We cannot engage them on the battlegrounds where they are strongest.

We will not win unless our movement grows quite significantly. How will we know it's grown big
enough? Instead of covert releases of animals at night, 1,000 of us will march to a factory farm and
liberate animal in broad daylight, unopposed. 500 of us will stand arm-in-arm blocking a
slaughterhouse entry, and we'll do it every day for a month. When we do these things, the public at
large will praise our bravery and commitment to equal consideration for all beings.

But we're not there yet.
