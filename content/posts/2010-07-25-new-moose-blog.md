The Moose Cabal now has [our own blog][1]. We plan to use this as a source of news about Moose development and usage, so add it to your feed reader if you&#8217;re interested.

Domain doesn&#8217;t resolve?

(also your anonymous commenting wants my name and email address).

I thought the domain was resolving consistently, but it seems like there&#8217;s some kinks in the DNS to work out. Hopefully that&#8217;ll be taken care of soon.

It resolved for me this morning (woops globalization, let&#8217;s say 5 hours ago), but an unfortunate refresh an hour ago brought it down.

Sigh. Now it prevents my feed reader from adding it.

Maybe an IP address in the meantime for those who just can&#8217;t wait ;)

The IP is 173.11.48.50, but you&#8217;ll need to change your hosts file, since the blog is one of many vhosts.

That works, thanks.
