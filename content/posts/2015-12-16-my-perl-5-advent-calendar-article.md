[My article on Stepford][1] for the Perl 5 advent calendar is now live. Maybe I can write an article
on Perl 4 or Perl 7 for the trifecta?

[Stepford][2] is a tool we wrote at MaxMind, Inc. to help automate our database build process. It's
like make but in Perl, and instead of writing a set of rules, you write a set of step classes and it
puts them all together. See the article for more details.
