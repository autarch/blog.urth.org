I suspect I&#8217;m not the only person who does this.

I start writing an email because I&#8217;m angry/annoyed/outraged/indignant. I write the whole thing. I sign it. I look at it. Then I discard it.

There&#8217;s something therapeutic about this. I get all of the benefits of venting without actually escalating a conflict. I wonder if there&#8217;s a market for an email client app or plugin that helps with this?

> &#8220;While you wrote this email your writing speed was 20% faster than your standard writing speed. Are you pissed off? Are you sure you want to send this?&#8221;

Clearly, I&#8217;m about to get rich!
