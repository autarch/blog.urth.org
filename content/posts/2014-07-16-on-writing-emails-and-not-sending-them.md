I suspect I'm not the only person who does this.

I start writing an email because I'm angry/annoyed/outraged/indignant. I write the whole thing. I sign it. I look at it. Then I discard it.

There's something therapeutic about this. I get all of the benefits of venting without actually escalating a conflict. I wonder if there's a market for an email client app or plugin that helps with this?

> "While you wrote this email your writing speed was 20% faster than your standard writing speed. Are you pissed off? Are you sure you want to send this?"

Clearly, I'm about to get rich!
