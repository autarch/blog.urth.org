I actually finished the grant about a week ago, but I&#8217;ve been so busy I forgot to say anything here!

The last recipe I wrote was a new Basics recipe on subclassing non-Moose classes. The original plan called for a recipe on hooking into Moose&#8217;s immutabilization system, but that part of Moose is really nasty, and Yuval Kogman has plans for a major re{factor,write}. There&#8217;s really no point is documenting what&#8217;s there now. If you&#8217;re really intrepid, you can cargo-cult from some other MooseX module.

Thanks to TPF for funding this grant. I think it&#8217;s led to some good improvements in the Moose docs. The feedback I&#8217;ve gotten on the Manual has been quite positive so far. Of course, nothing&#8217;s really ever _done_, so patches and suggestions are welcome.

Congratulations!  
I think Moose is indeed a building block in a more modern, enlightened Perl and any aspect of it that is improved does a great service to the whole community.
