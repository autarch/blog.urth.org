I actually finished the grant about a week ago, but I've been so busy I forgot to say anything here!

The last recipe I wrote was a new Basics recipe on subclassing non-Moose classes. The original plan called for a recipe on hooking into Moose's immutabilization system, but that part of Moose is really nasty, and Yuval Kogman has plans for a major re{factor,write}. There's really no point is documenting what's there now. If you're really intrepid, you can cargo-cult from some other MooseX module.

Thanks to TPF for funding this grant. I think it's led to some good improvements in the Moose docs. The feedback I've gotten on the Manual has been quite positive so far. Of course, nothing's really ever _done_, so patches and suggestions are welcome.

Congratulations!  
I think Moose is indeed a building block in a more modern, enlightened Perl and any aspect of it that is improved does a great service to the whole community.
