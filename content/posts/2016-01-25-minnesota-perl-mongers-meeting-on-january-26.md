I should&#8217;ve posted this earlier, but better late than never. We&#8217;re having the first MPM meeting in many years on Tuesday, January 26. Please [see the meetup event for details][1]. I&#8217;ll be speaking about Perl 6 and Arthur Goldstein will be giving a short intro-level presentation on Perl 5.
