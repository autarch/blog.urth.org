My [Introduction to Moose class][1] is back at YAPC::NA 2016. This year's class will take place on
Thursday, June 23. I'm excited to be doing this course again. It's gotten great reviews from past
students. [Sign up today][2].

And of course, there are tons of other great offerings this year too, including several from the
legendary Damian Conway! I already signed up for his Presentation Aikido course on Friday, June 24.
