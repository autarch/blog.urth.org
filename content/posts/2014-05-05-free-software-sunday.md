I&#8217;ve been in Taiwan for about four weeks now. Most of the time I was working remotely (more remotely than usual), but for the last few days I&#8217;ve been on a real vacation in Taipei. I&#8217;ve had time to kill while my wife talks to her relatives (my Mandarin is not good enough for extended conversations) so I&#8217;ve been trying to work through my all too large rt.cpan and GH PR backlogs.

The past year or two I haven&#8217;t had as much time or energy for my free software projects as in the past. Part of this is that my current job at [MaxMind][1] is generally engaging and interesting. I actually get to work on some neat projects there, including the recently released [Stepford][2]. Between work, family health issues, and the time I spend planning events like [Twin Cities Veg Fest][3], I haven&#8217;t had much time for FS/OSS work.

But I realized that if I could just allocate a few hours per month I could probably get a lot done, at least in terms of addressing small bugs and patches for my CPAN modules. To that end, I&#8217;ve added a new recurring 3 hour block to my calendar every other Sunday labelled &#8220;Free Software Sunday&#8221;. I&#8217;ve given myself permission to ignore that event when it pops up, but it will still be a good reminder.

My apologies to all of you who&#8217;ve submitted bug reports and patches in the past and haven&#8217;t received a response. If there&#8217;s something in particular you want me to look at, please comment on the rt.cpan ticket or GH PR again to remind me.
