I will be offering my [Introduction to Go class][1] at this year Perl & Raku Conference in the
Cloud. The cost is just $50, with all proceeds going to The Perl Foundation. **You can [register for
this class using Eventbrite][2].**

This year I have the class capped at just 10 people, because this is my first time doing this
online. I've found an online classroom solution that allows all attendees to share their screens
simultaneously, so I'll be able to virtually look over your shoulder while you're working on the
exercises .

This course is aimed at folks who know another language (like Perl, for example) but donâ€™t know
anything about Go. Go is seeing fairly wide adoption for many purposes these days, including devops
tools like Docker and Kubernetes, as well as for CLI tools, servers, and more.
