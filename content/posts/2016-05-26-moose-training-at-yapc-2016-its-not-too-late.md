It&#8217;s not too late to sign up for my [Introduction to Moose class][1] at YAPC::NA 2016. This year&#8217;s class will take place on Thursday, June 23. I&#8217;m excited to be doing this course again. It&#8217;s gotten great reviews from past students. [Sign up today][2].

There are lots of other great courses. For the first time ever, I&#8217;m also going to be a student. I&#8217;m looking forward to attending Damian Conway&#8217;s Presentation Aikido course on Friday, June 24.
