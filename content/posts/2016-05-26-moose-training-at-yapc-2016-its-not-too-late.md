It's not too late to sign up for my [Introduction to Moose class][1] at YAPC::NA 2016. This year's class will take place on Thursday, June 23. I'm excited to be doing this course again. It's gotten great reviews from past students. [Sign up today][2].

There are lots of other great courses. For the first time ever, I'm also going to be a student. I'm looking forward to attending Damian Conway's Presentation Aikido course on Friday, June 24.
