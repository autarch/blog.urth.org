Ok, that alliteration is a stretch, but it's the best I could do.

This blog post is a public announcement to say that my tuits for CPAN-related work will be in very
short supply until after YAPC. I'm basically devoting all of my FOSS programming time to creating
the slides and exercises for my [Introduction to Go YAPC master class][1]. As you might imagine,
creating a one day class is a lot of work. My goal is to finish a teachable draft by May 29 so I can
give the class here in Minneapolis on May 30 as a test run. If you're interested in taking the class
then, stay tuned to this blog for details.
