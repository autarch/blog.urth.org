I&#8217;m doing my one-day Moose class here in Minneapolis again, as part of [Frozen Perl][1]. The class is even cheaper this time, as a special deal for the workshop. It&#8217;s a mere $100 per person!

The class is an interactive course, meaning you bring your laptop and do exercises in between lecture sections. It covers all the basics of Moose, and even gets into some of the more advanced bits.

Here&#8217;s what students who took the class back in September said:

  * &#8220;The exercises were awesome! I really love how they were set up as test cases&#8211;there is really no other way to give this much feedback!&#8221; &#8211; wu
  * &#8220;Using the test framework to drive the exercises was brilliant, providing feedback and building confidence. The exercises weren&#8217;t too difficult, and the detailed, step-by-step instructions helped to make them friendly.&#8221; &#8211; Ken O

You can sign up and pay for the class at the [Frozen Perl][1] site. I&#8217;d also encourage you to join us for the workshop the next day. There&#8217;s a good slate of presentations scheduled, and it should be a lot of fun.

Finally, on Sunday, February 7, we&#8217;ll be having a hackathon. See the Frozen Perl site for details.
