My employer [MaxMind][1] is hiring for two engineering positions. We have a positions for a
[Software Engineer in Test][2] and a [Software Engineer][3]. If you've always wanted to work with
me, here's your chance. If you've always wanted to avoid working with me, now you have the knowledge
needed to achieve that goal. It's a win-win either way!

Note that while this is a remote position, we're pretty limited in what US states we can hire from
(Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, North Carolina, and Oregon). All of Canada is fair game. I'm
trying to figure out if we can expand the state pool somehow. If you think you're the awesomest
candidate ever, send your resume anyway. That way if something does change, we have you on our list.

Sounds like a super job... curious why the geographic limitation? If one would set up an LLC in one
of those states, would that work? Just curious... remote perl jobs are not easy to find.

Jim, I have no idea about the LLC. We're a pretty small company, so doing such a thing is not really
something we'd consider at this point, I'm sure.

Thanks, Dave... the jobs look super, especially for an old time perl person with an Earth Sciences,
Geography,, and GIS background (shameless plug). BTW, love GeoIP - use the free files all the time,
both with my own code and other products that incorporate it. Keep up the good work! Jim

Are you able to talk at all broadly about compensation?

**Dave Rolsky, on 2016-06-30 12:53, said:**  
The job descriptions include compensation details.

Hi, I am from Ukraine, but I am planning move to Canada.  
Is it possible to apply me to this vocation?

**Dave Rolsky, on 2016-07-04 09:07, said:**  
Hi Eugen, I think you can apply, as long as you'll be able to work in Canada.

Any chance I might be of interest? I'm in Toronto. If yes, then I'll comply with the formal
procedures.

**Dave Rolsky, on 2016-07-04 11:45, said:**  
The best way to find out is to apply. We can definitely hire from Toronto.
