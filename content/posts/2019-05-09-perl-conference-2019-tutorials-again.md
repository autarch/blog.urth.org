I just wanted to remind my many, many, many readers (all 3 of you) that I will be offering two
tutorials at this year's [Perl Conference in Pittsburgh, PA][1]. Also, last time I posted about this
I got the dates of the courses swapped because I am very smart.

**You can sign up for these courses at [the conference's Eventbrite ticketing page][2].**

On Thursday, June 20 I’m offering my [Introduction to Go][3] course. This course is aimed at folks
who know another language (like Perl, for example) but don’t know anything about Go. Go is seeing
fairly wide adoption for many purposes these days, including devops tools like Docker and
Kubernetes, as well as for CLI tools, servers, and more.

On Friday, June 21 I’ll be offering my [Introduction to Moose][3] course. **This is likely to be the
last time I will offer this course so sign up now.** If you want learn more about using Moose this
is a great opportunity. I’d also note that most of what I cover applies to Moo, so what you’ll learn
is useful in many situations.

Both courses cost $165, which is a great deal in my humble opinion.
