I was getting a bit tired of my [old blog theme][1] so [here&#8217;s a new one][2]. This new theme uses [Bootstrap 4][3] under the hood, courtesy of the [Understrap theme][4]Â and [understrap-child][5]. The main thing bugging me about the old theme was the font sizes and all the boxiness of the right-hand side widgets. Whenever I&#8217;d look at my own blog I&#8217;d have to hit Ctrl-+ a few times. That seems like a bad sign. This new theme should fix it.

Please [let me know][6] if you spot any issues.
