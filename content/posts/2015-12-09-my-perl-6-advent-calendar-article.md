I wrote an article for the Perl 6 advent calendar, [Perl 6 Pod][1], that just went live earlier this evening.

I'll also have a Perl 5 advent calendar article coming up soon on December 16. Am I the only person to write an article for both the Perl 5 and Perl 6 advent calendars this year? I guess we'll find out on December 25.
