I was listening to Massive Attack's _Mezzanine_ today and I happened to notice that I was missing a track in Rhythmbox. I bought this CD ages ago, and it's been in my MP3 library for a long time, so it's funny that I just noticed this.

I went back to my old home-made MP3 server thingy and looked for the track, but it was missing there too.

Now, I could've gone downstairs and looked at my dusty shelves of CDs, found the CD (eventually), and ripped it. But that just seems like a waste of time. Instead, I went to [The Pirate Bay][1] and found a copy ripped at 320kpbs. It should be on my computer in about 15 minutes or so.

It's simply more convenient for me to download a "pirate" version than to rip my own CD. I wonder if this is illegal or not, since I do own the media, and when I made the original MP3, I was doing something legal. If someone else makes the MP3 for me and I download it, is that also legal?

Reminds me of a friend I had who bought the Diablo I CD (when it just came out) and was so fearful that it would get ruined, that he burnt a copy of it and played with the copy only, keeping the original intact and untouched.
