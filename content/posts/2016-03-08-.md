A few more notes on the interview process.

**Don't ask pointless questions.** For our most recent round of interviews, I went through the list of potential questions with another interviewer asking what we hoped to learn from each question. If we couldn't figure that out, we removed the question. Sometimes we realized that what we wanted to learn was worthwhile but we needed to rewrite the question to achieve that goal. Don't ask questions because they're fun for you or vaguely interesting or because someone asked you the same thing once. Remember that being interviewed can be stressful for many people, so don't ask questions that don't provide value to you.

**Keep it conversational and friendly.** This goes back to interview stress. Introduce yourselves at the start of the interview. If you're funny, be a little funny so they know you're a human (PG-rated only, of course). Encourage them to ask questions as you go. Follow up on things they say with related questions rather than robotically sticking to a pre-determined list. If they give a particularly good answer tell them so.

**Give them time.** Try not to interrupt the candidate. Let them take a breath to think if they need to. Say "thank you" or "that was interesting" after an answer so you don't just rush from question to question. Also make sure to give them a block of time to ask their own questions (I usually do this in the last 15 minutes of a 1 hour interview).
