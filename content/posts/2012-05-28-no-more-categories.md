I&#8217;ve removed the per-category Atom feeds from the sidebar, and I&#8217;m going to stop categorizing new entries.

There are a couple reasons. First, the three categories are somewhat limiting. My next entry will not fall strictly into the AR-Veg, Personal, or Programming categories.

Second, the vast majority of my entries are about programming, and that will probably continue to be true. I realized that most anything I&#8217;d categorize as Personal is either trivial or something I don&#8217;t want to share on a blog. For the AR-Veg stuff, I plan to simply publish any future writing on that topic in my [animal rights group&#8217;s email newsletter][1].

The existing pre-category Atom feed URIs will not redirect to the &#8220;everything&#8221; feed.
