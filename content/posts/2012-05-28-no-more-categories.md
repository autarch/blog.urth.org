I've removed the per-category Atom feeds from the sidebar, and I'm going to stop categorizing new
entries.

There are a couple reasons. First, the three categories are somewhat limiting. My next entry will
not fall strictly into the AR-Veg, Personal, or Programming categories.

Second, the vast majority of my entries are about programming, and that will probably continue to be
true. I realized that most anything I'd categorize as Personal is either trivial or something I
don't want to share on a blog. For the AR-Veg stuff, I plan to simply publish any future writing on
that topic in my [animal rights group's email newsletter][1].

The existing pre-category Atom feed URIs will not redirect to the "everything" feed.
