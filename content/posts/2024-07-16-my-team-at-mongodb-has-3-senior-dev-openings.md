My team at MongoDB is **three** Senior Engineers. For these positions you can be 100% remote in the
US or Canada or you can choose to work from one our offices. Our schedule is based around our NYC
office on the east coast, so if you're on the west coast your hours would need to account for that.

My team primarily works on
[MongoDB's Cluster-to-Cluster Sync product](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/cluster-to-cluster-sync/current/).
It's an interesting and challenging product to work on. As a big bonus, this is _not_ a live a
service and there's no on-call. We do actual product releases, which still feels like a novelty to
me after so many years doing web apps and services.

There are two different postings for the US and Canada:

- [United States](https://grnh.se/1e9e68151us)
- [Canada](https://grnh.se/1b7bdf8e1us)

(Note that these are referral links so I get credit for referring you if you use them.)

I've been at MongoDB since May of this 2022 and it's been great. If you have questions about the
position, the team, or working at MongoDB, [please reach out](mailto:autarch@urth.org).
