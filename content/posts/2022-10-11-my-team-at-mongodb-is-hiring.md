My team at MongoDB is [hiring a senior engineer](https://grnh.se/259028f41us). For this position you
can be 100% remote or you can choose to work from one our offices.

I've been at MongoDB since May of this year and so far it's been great. If you have questions about
the position, the team, or working at MongoDB, [please reach out](mailto:autarch@urth.org).
