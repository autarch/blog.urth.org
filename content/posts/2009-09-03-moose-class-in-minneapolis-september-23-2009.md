The class is scheduled for Wednesday, September 23, 2009, from 8:30am to 5:00pm. The class will be at the [Days Inn in Minneapolis][1] near the U of MN campus. There is free on-site parking at the hotel.

The class will run all day, with an hour or so lunch break. I will not be serving food or drinks, but you are welcome to bring your own, of course.

In order to attend, you must register in advance. You can [register through the Perl Review][2] and pay online. The class costs $120 per person. This is a very low introductory rate, and future classes will cost substantially more, so take advantage of this opportunity while you can.

Enrollment is limited to 16 people in total.

Here&#8217;s the full class description &#8230;.

## Intro to Moose

Join us for an interactive hands-on course all about Moose. Moose is an OO system for Perl 5 that provides a simple declarative layer of &#8220;sugar&#8221; on top of a powerful, extensible meta-model.

With Moose, simple classes can be created without writing any subroutines, and complex classes can be simplified. Moose&#8217;s features include a powerful attribute declaration system, type constraints and coercions, method modifiers (&#8220;before&#8221;, &#8220;after&#8221;, and &#8220;around&#8221;), a role system (like mixins on steroids), and more. Moose also has a vibrant ecosystem of extensions as seen in the variety of MooseX:: modules on CPAN.

This course will cover Moose&#8217;s core features, dip a toe into the meta-model, and explore some of the more powerful MooseX:: modules available on CPAN.

Students are expected to bring a laptop, as you will be writing code during the class. You will also be provided with a tarball a week or so before the class is scheduled, which will contain a directory tree skeleton and test files.
