At my last job we used [Web::Machine][1] extensively. I ended up getting comaint of this distro and the accompanying [HTTP::Headers::ActionPack][2] distro as a result. To the best of my knowledge, no one else with current PAUSE permissions is really working on these distros either.

I'm no longer at MaxMind, and I don't see myself using Web::Machine at my new position. As such, both of these distros could use some attention from someone who is using them. If you're interested please [let me know][3] and I'll work with Stevan Little (who has primary) to give you PAUSE permissions. I can also transfer the GitHub repos to another person or org.
