I read about [tofu misozuke][1] on the vegan subreddit recently and I was intrigued. The description compared it to cheese, particularly blue cheese, and I was sold. I love pungent, strong-tasting foods.

I just got my order today. Holy crap, it&#8217;s intense! The blue cheese comparison is quite apt. It&#8217;s also similar to Tofu ru (or dou fu ru in the proper Chinese pronunciation). I had mine on a slice of toast and it was perfect.

Either way, I highly recommend this stuff for connoisseurs of intense flavors.
