upgrade._

In my last post, [AR2007 Thoughts - The Good][1], I discussed the things I liked about the
conference. Now I'll reveal my cranky side. "Reveal" probably isn't the right word though, since
it's not exactly hidden.

### The Bad

The bad part of the conference was basically the "official" stuff. The conference could be better
organized in a number of ways. Logistically, it needs some serious help, and the presentation
sessions were mostly unsatisfying.

I'm going to continually contrast this to the many programming conferences I've attended, which have
excellent coordination and logistics. The majority of the programming conferences I've attended are
organized entirely by volunteers, so my standards are not unreasonably high. I'll also point out
that at AR2007 I mostly attended the more practically focused (in theory) "how-to" type sessions.

To be blunt, most of the speakers weren't very good. I don't think it's worthwhile to blast
individuals, but there were some recurring problems. The most common problem was with content. Many
speakers lacked a focus, and basically rambled on about personal experiences, without connecting
that experience back to any sort of practical knowledge that listeners could use. They spoke about
the "what" without the "how". This is obviously a problem for a "how-to"! I think this problem was
probably exacerbated by the weird way speakers are selected and scheduled, which I'll talk about
later.

And how about some visual aids, folks? Most speakers had no slides (aka PowerPoint) and no handouts.
I hate handouts, since they're a waste of paper, but they're better than nothing. To those who did
have slides, please do not read the slides to the audience! This is almost worse than no slides at
all. (If you saw me in your talk and for some reason you want to hear my specific take on your
presentation, you can [email me][2]. I'm full of opinions ;).

I will pick on one person by name, however, and that's Alex Hershaft. Alex is the founder of
[FARM][3], which hosts the conference, and I think he's in charge of scheduling. Alex scheduled
himself to participate in a whopping _thirteen_ sessions out of about eighty-something in total (a
little more than an eighth). Holy egomania, Batman! I'm excluding the opening and closing remarks
from my count, since that's where you'd typically expect to find the conference organizer(s)
speaking.

Alex has worked in animal rights for over thirty years, which is really cool, and I'm sure he's
learned many things. But don't we have other people who know about these topics? Shouldn't we be
trying to cultivate speaking and presentation skills? Given that scheduling was so tight that most
people were given 10 minute speaking slots, couldn't he have given those slots to others?

I think I'm a pretty good speaker, and I know about lots of things, but when CAA does a conference I
promise not to schedule myself in an eighth of the sessions!

Let's get to the scheduling and speaker selection problems. First of all, there's no [call for
speakers][4] on the conference website. I don't think FARM's intention is to exclude newcomers, but
it sure gives the impression that there's an "in group" and "the rest of us".

I submitted two talk proposals with titles and outlines. Both of these talks were on technical
topics (wikis, email, online donations, etc). I picked these topics because that's where my
expertise lies, being a programmer by profession and geek by choice.

The first thing I heard back was that I had been accepted to speak, but there was no indication of
_which_ talks had been accepted. Then, about a month before the conference, I got an email telling
me I was assigned to two sessions, "Publishing on the Internet" and "Running a Local Group". Why was
I assigned to "Running a Local Group"? I have no idea. Gil Schwartz, CAA's Volunteer Coordinator,
submitted a talk on this same topic and was rejected, even though this is his area of expertise. I
found the whole experience disrespectful and discouraging, as if speakers were merely
interchangeable cogs in the conference machine.

By contrast, for a technical conference, I submit a talk with a title and description, and it's
accepted as-is, or not accepted at all. On occasion, the organizers may ask me to tweak the content
to avoid overlap with other speakers, or to choose a clearer title, but this is not done without
discussing it with me. I also get more than a month's notice, giving me ample time to prepare and do
my best.

At the AR conference, the session titles are extremely generic, like "Publishing on the Internet".
Speakers are not identified individually by talk, they don't get to "advertise" their talks with
their chosen titles, and they may not even be assigned to their choice of topic! To make it worse,
they're assigned with a group of other people they don't know and left to coordinate specific
topics, times, and speaking order by themselves.

This discourages a sense of ownership, and I think it contributed to the poor quality of many
presentations. When people are given both power and responsibility together, they will rise to the
occassion and give it their best effort. When you take this away, it's easy to be discouraged.

This sort of scheduling also doesn't serve attendees very well. They don't know what individual
speakers will talk about, they can't easily hop between sessions, and they can't "follow" their
favorite speakers with any granularity. By contrast, check out [the schedule from YAPC::NA 2007][5],
the last tech conference I attended.

At YAPC, the schedule details every single talk for every single speaker. It's easy to leave a
session early if you're bored. Take a look at Tuesday starting at 10:30 AM. If you attend the
session in the Houston Room and don't like it, you know that there will be a number of other
sessions beginning at 10:55.

The ridiculously small amount of time allocated to most speakers at AR2007 is also problematic. Ten
to twelve minutes isn't enough to do more than scratch the surface of most topics. At tech
conferences, a short session is twenty minutes, and longer ones may be fifty minutes or two hours.

The conference quality would be better with fewer speakers who spoke longer. Sure, there'd still be
bad presentations, but the good ones would go longer, and with a post-conference survey, the
organizers could make sure to get the good speakers back next year.

Another irritation was the how hard it was to self-organize informal sessions. People planning to
attend the conference had no mechanism to connect with each other before or during the conference,
other than word-of-mouth. At tech conferences, we always have a [wiki][6] and a mailing list for the
conference. People use them to plan [get-togethers for early arrivals][7], [birds of a feather
sessions (BOFs)][8] during the conference, [dinner outings][9], game playing (Go, anyone?), and so
on.

We also make sure to leave plenty of space for self-organized sessions at tech conferences. The
presentation part of the day ends around 4:30 or 5:00. There may be a social event in the evening
(bowling, dinner, etc), but we always leave a few hours of down time before that, and we make it
easy to schedule BOFs, social events, and outings.

I would've loved to have met up with [VegGuide.Org][10] users and shown them the alpha version of
VegGuide 3.0, talked about what they like and dislike about the guide, and just meet people. I think
there was some sort of mechanism for doing this through the conference organizers, but that's yet
another barrier to entry. I shouldn't have to ask anyone, particularly the people who are going to
be the busiest at the conference! To make this even harder, there were sessions scheduled every
evening from 7:15 to 9:30, which meant that the only free times for self-organizing were over lunch,
or after 9:30, when we were all exhausted and just wanted to chill.

Given that the best part of every conference is always hanging out with people, it's really
important to make this as easy as possible. No matter how good the sessions are, the hallway track
is more fun, and a good conference puts a lot of effort into facilitating spontaneous organization.

Anyway, that's enough complaining. There was a [good side][1] to the conference as well, and I would
still go back, mostly to meet people. I also just enjoyed being around a lot of people enthused
about animal rights activism. Ultimately the conference was energizing for me, reminding me how
important this movement is, and how far we have to go.
