[Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE)][1] is an organization focused on improving the effectiveness of animal advocacy overall. As part of their work, they evaluate other organizations and make recommendations on which ones are the best targets for donations. So how seriously should you take these recommendations? Here&#8217;s my take on that question.

First of all, ACE does other work besides evaluating charities. They&#8217;ve led or participated in various research efforts to better understand the effectiveness of different types of advocacy, they generally encourage effective altruism among animal advocates, and do a lot of other stuff. I don&#8217;t have any criticisms to offer of these efforts. I&#8217;m very much in favor of what they&#8217;re doing there, though I have no idea how effective it is.

But what about their evaluations? Here&#8217;s the TLDR &#8230; take them with a very large grain of salt. We don&#8217;t have nearly enough information yet to make strong recommendations on which charities are the most effective.

Of course, I (sort of) understand why ACE makes strong statements. If they just said &#8220;we&#8217;re 20% confident that these charities are the best&#8221; then nobody would listen to them, and they might as well not bother. Would not bothering be a better outcome? If their advice encourages people to shift donations from organizations that focus on less effective areas of advocacy, like companion animals, then the net result is a plus for animals. On the other hand, if their recommendations simply move money between organizations focused on farm animals, then they are not achieving anything of value.

So why do I say that their recommendations should be taken with a grain of salt? There are a number of reasons. I&#8217;ll break them down one by one.

### We have no idea what is effective

As of this writing, in October 2015, we have very little understanding of what interventions are most effective on behalf of farm animals. This is a **very** difficult topic to research, and it will probably take a lot of time and money to address this. There are several problems here. 

First, it&#8217;s very hard (maybe impossible?) to do a proper double blind study of any intervention. Almost by definition, any controlled in-lab study will not be representative of real world performance. How do you hand out leaflets in a lab? In the real world, many people won&#8217;t even take a leaflet in the first place. In a lab setting, how do you account for people who take a leaflet and then throw it out, or don&#8217;t read it, or skim through it, or read it carefully and then pass it on to friends?

Second, the numbers of people involved in a study need to be huge in order for the study to be useful. Again, consider leafleting. [One study][2] found that 1 in 50 recipients went vegetarian or pescatarian after receiving a leaflet, and another 1 in 14 significantly reduced their consumption of at least some animal products. This study has been rightly criticized for various methodological flaws. But even ignoring that, when you consider that only about 7% of the people receiving a leaflet might make any change, it&#8217;s clear that we&#8217;d need very large numbers to draw strong conclusions about effectiveness.

### We have no idea what is effective over the long term

The lack of certainty is actually much worse than you might imagine. [A recent study by Faunalytics on current and former vegetarians][3] concluded that approximately 80% of people who go vegetarian or vegan will abandon the diet.

This means that any study of initial interventions is telling us a very small part of the story. We also need to know what interventions will best help people stick with their diet changes.

### short term vs long term &#8211; community building, etc.

ACE&#8217;s recommendations are all for organizations focused primarily on outreach. I define outreach as sharing information about animals with the general public. This can take the form of ads, media campaigns, leafleting, Pay-Per-View video, etc. I&#8217;d also include things like MFA&#8217;s undercover investigations in this area, as the goal of these investigations is to generate materials for use in outreach.

Outreach is obviously very important. We will never achieve social change without it. But it should also be obvious that it takes more than just outreach to achieve change.

As the Faunalytics recidivism study shows, we have a severe problem with retaining people. I think that organizations that provide

### focusing on measurability

### Should you donate to ACE&#8217;s recommended charities?

Yes, absolutely. They recommend a number
