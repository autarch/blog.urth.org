I wrote a prototype of a tool to "declare bankruptcy" on your Sqitch migrations and start over. If
you have a project with 50, 100, or more migrations, this might be useful for you. The details are

[blog post I wrote on the ActiveState blog](https://www.activestate.com/blog/a-sqitch-declare-bankruptcy-prototype/).
