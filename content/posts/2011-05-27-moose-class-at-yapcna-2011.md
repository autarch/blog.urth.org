I'll be offering a one day Intro to Moose class at [YAPC::NA 2011][1] in lovely Asheville, NC. To register, log in to the YAPC::NA site and then go to [purchasing page][2]. If you haven't registered for YAPC yet, you can buy your conference ticket at the same time too.

## Intro to Moose

Join us for an interactive hands-on course all about Moose, an OO system for Perl 5 that provides a simple declarative layer of "sugar" on top of a powerful, extensible meta-model.

With Moose, simple classes can be created without writing any subroutines, and complex classes can be simplified. Moose's features include a powerful attribute declaration system, type constraints and coercions, method modifiers ("before", "after", and "around"), a role system (like mixins on steroids), and more. Moose also has a vibrant ecosystem of extensions as seen in the variety of MooseX:: modules on CPAN.

This course will cover Moose's core features, dip a toe into the meta-model, and explore some of the more powerful MooseX:: modules available on CPAN.

Students are expected to bring a laptop, as you will be writing code during the class. You will also be provided with a tarball a week or so before the class is scheduled, which will contain a directory tree skeleton and test files.

A detailed intro into Moose and MooseX:: would be very nice. What's with the people in Europe (or those who can't make it to Asheville, NC generally)? 

Will you publish bits of the class for public access?
