I just got back from seeing [The Magnetic Fields][1], and it was a great show. It got me thinking about the most memorable concerts I&#8217;ve seen over the years.

In no particular order &#8230;

  * Weird Al at Toad&#8217;s Place in New Haven, 1991 (or 1992). I know how deeply uncool it is to admit this, but I&#8217;ve seen Weird Al live, and it was great. I think this was the first rock concert I ever went to, in fact. Weird Al did a great live show, with all sorts of wacky costume changes, weird dances, and a generally kick-ass performance. 
  * Most of the They Might Be Giants shows I&#8217;ve seen. I think they may be the second band I saw live, and I&#8217;ve seen them many times since. 
  * The first time I saw Einsturzende Neubaten. I was amazed at how good the sound was for such a complicated set of instruments. I also appreciated the fact that it was loud, but not way too fucking loud, like many concerts I&#8217;ve been to. 
  * Tokyo Incidents at the Kamakura Cultural Center. This may be the single best concert I&#8217;ve ever been to. This band is amazing, and the singer, Ringo Shiina, is one of the best singers I&#8217;ve ever heard. A lot of what she sang was quite vocally demanding, and she and the band nailed every note. Combine that with great sound and acoustics (yay for concert halls). 
  * Seeing the Minneapolis Orchestra perform Messiaen&#8217;s Turangalila, and a few years later Britten&#8217;s War Requiem. These are two of my all time favorite pieces. I&#8217;ve also loved seeing George Crumb&#8217;s chamber works live. I saw Music for a Summer Evening (Makrokosmos III) and then years later Vox Balanae, and both were amazing. 
  * Seeing Low perform at Orchestra Hall. The acoustics of the hall worked incredibly well with their minimalist music. I&#8217;ve seen Low many times live, but I think this was my favorite, just cause it sounded so good. 

And finally, one dishonorable mention.

  * The Polyphonic Spree at The Fine Line. This wasn&#8217;t the band&#8217;s fault, I think they might have been doing a fine job. However, the sound was so amazingly loud that I couldn&#8217;t really hear any music, just a roar of noise from which I could sort of pick out musical sounds. This was a huge disappointment, because I&#8217;d been very excited to see them. I think some sound engineers are deaf, and they crank everything to 11. They need to be fired.
