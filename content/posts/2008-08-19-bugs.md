No, unfortunately not the programming kind. Those I can deal with.

No, these are in my house, but mostly my home office, keeps getting full of these weird bugs. I think they&#8217;re [Chinch Bugs][1], though my friend John swears he&#8217;s seen them before and they&#8217;re something else.

Either way, it&#8217;s very annoying. They don&#8217;t bite or sting, but I just don&#8217;t like bugs. What&#8217;s even more disturbing is the vast hordes of them I can see out the windows.

Here&#8217;s to the first freeze of winter! (probably just a few short months away :( )
