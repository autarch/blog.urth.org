No, unfortunately not the programming kind. Those I can deal with.

No, these are in my house, but mostly my home office, keeps getting full of these weird bugs. I think they're [Chinch Bugs][1], though my friend John swears he's seen them before and they're something else.

Either way, it's very annoying. They don't bite or sting, but I just don't like bugs. What's even more disturbing is the vast hordes of them I can see out the windows.

Here's to the first freeze of winter! (probably just a few short months away :( )
