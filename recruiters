I had a huge number of people, mostly recruiters, contact me on LinkedIn since
October, when I changed my status to "open to work". At first, I said check
back later, and then I started telling them to check back in March once I had
a date in mind for starting my job search. Most of them haven't checked back,
but a subset did.

A lot of the recruiters would write something like "I have a position open for
Java development with Swing using Oracle. Based on your profile I think you'd
be a great fit for this position." Of course, this mystified me, since I'm a
terrible fit for that position. But a few did _actually_ read my profile and
contact me for relevant jobs.

By the end of February I'd come up with the first version of [my job search
TLDR]({{< relref
"2022-03-07-let-the-job-search-begin-and-my-first-interviews.md" >}}). A lot
of recruiters simply didn't respond after I sent this, which I'll assume meant
that they didn't have anything that met my criteria.

Am I complaining about recruiters too much? I feel like this is a really
overdone genre of tech blog post.

Anyway, ultimately some of the recruiters actually contacted me for relevant
positions.
